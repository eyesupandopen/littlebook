<h1 id="ph">Behold! Judgment Comes and the Times are Now!</h1>
<div id="prophecy"> 
<p>The times have come for fulfillment, my little ones, even fulfillment of all things concerning Daniel's seventieth week. For Daniel's seventieth week is a week of years where each day is a year. Daniel's seventieth week is about to be fulfilled and will begin as the faithful in my Church are snatched away to meet me in the clouds. The last trump shall sound and with a mighty voice of the archangel the dead in Christ will rise first, and you which are alive and remain will be caught up in the clouds with them, and so shall you ever be with me, even Christ Jesus, for I am the resurrected Nazarene who died to sin once and who dies no more. For my kingdom is from everlasting to everlasting, and of my kingdom there shall be no end, for Yahweh has so declared.</p>
<p>When my faithful are taken into the heavens, so too will the restrainer be removed, and so shall the start of Daniel's seventieth week begin. Many of you struggle with the concept of me, Yeshua HaMashiach, catching my faithful ones away from judgment that is not intended for them, yet I will cause you to understand, should you come to me with the humility of a little child, even the innocence and curiosity of a little one. For you are my little ones, even my little ones who see through a glass darkly and who prophesy in part. And so I say to you, humble yourselves and repent from your worthless pride, for it is sin, and come to me to learn and accept holy scripture. To reject any section of scripture is sin, for every Word of God is pure and to be received with respect for obedience, and I, Jesus the Nazarene, am the word made flesh.</p>
<p>The gathering of my saints to me in the clouds was a mystery hidden within the great mystery of God. So it was a mystery within a mystery and therefore was not revealed until it was revealed to the Apostle Paul in his letters. To him was revealed the great mystery of God, for Paul was also a steward of God's mysteries, for so I commissioned him. And so understand that to deny scripture on this event is to deny me and to be among the foolish virgins.</p>
<p>And so I will explain to you many things that are about to come to pass, even continuing the works I gave to John the Revelator, for the testimony of my revealing is written to conceal as it reveals. And so now I will tell you things before they happen so that you are prepared for the days ahead. For I, Christ Jesus, will cause my people to stand in the works where I am sending them so that you may complete to the uttermost the many mighty works I have for you to accomplish.</p>
<p>As the gathering together happens, the restrainer is removed, and great destruction will overtake the earth, suddenly and in an instant. For as the restrainer is removed, nothing will remain to hinder the evil in the world and the lusts and evil passions of mankind. Great war will break across the earth, and brother will once again rise to kill their brother, and great shall their destruction be. Many nations will fall as Mystery Babylon, even that great whore who sits on many waters, will be made desolate in one hour.</p>
<p>That great city, even that nation of many United States, will be utterly destroyed; for she has earned a double portion of judgment, and she is worthy. For she lived deliciously in great sin; she sits in great arrogance thinking she can never fall and things will continue, yesterday as today, and tomorrow ever more the same and unchanging. And the great whore has corrupted the earth with the golden cup in her hand, full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication. And so her judgment will fall suddenly. Great fire will overtake her cities as missiles fall; great shaking will occur, and that nation will split along the middle. Her coasts will be greatly flooded, and never will she rise again, for great are her sins and great is her judgment.</p>
<p>As war breaks across the land and the horseman execute their judgments on the earth, great misery and desolation will come on the world. The world that now is will never again be; when the restrainer is removed, everything will be different. There will be great death, pestilence, great famine, and great injustice; and yet my 144,000 will be protected from wrath and judgment, for they will carry the seal of the Living God, even Yahweh, in their foreheads; for so will they be sealed, and I send my angels to seal them. And so great chaos and lawlessness will rule the day. The first 42 months will be times of great persecution and great trouble, but the great tribulation will happen in the second 42 months: for there are 84 months in the seven days of years of Jacob's trouble. And so the second half is the great tribulation, but the tribulation and persecution on the land will be horrible for the inhabitants of the earth the entire time.</p>
<p>For neither me, Christ Jesus the Ascended Lord, nor Yahweh, the great eternal God (for there is none like Him), have any pleasure in the coming judgments and troubles. My Father did not create mankind in love so that he could judge and destroy them. Yet, Satan has corrupted God's garden of grace, and now the corruption will be cleansed away so that righteousness may rule. And so there is no other choice for salvation for those who rejected my call of salvation during the age of grace. People must awaken from their slumber and the pleasures of sin, for there is no more time and now is the time to forever choose, or the choice will be made in judgment for those who reject me by refusing to choose. Many troubles and the coming judgments will awaken many to eternal salvation, even snatching them from the eternal fires; for many are drunk on the pleasures of sin, and so pleasures will be taken away. They will have no more pleasure in these days, and survival will be a minute-by-minute affair at times, and much danger will abound.</p>
<p>So will it be that my faithful and chosen among my Church will be hidden away from the times of Jacob's trouble in the heavens. And their works will be judged by fire, and whosoever's works remain will receive reward and whosoever's works are burned will suffer loss, but they themselves will be saved, so as yet by fire. They will take their places in the order prepared for them in the heavens. For I, Yeshua HaMashiach, am worthy to take the book and open the seals, and with the opening of the seals the horsemen are loosed. And they will go forth in the earth to conquer, to make war, to cause pestilence and great death. The seven trumpets will sound, woes are coming, and the seven vials of the indignation of the wrath of God will be poured out on the earth in full.</p>
<p>The coming world war will not last for years, because Satan knows that he has but a short time, yet war will be ever present during these times of trouble. Out of the ruins and horrors of war will rise the beast from the sea, and the beast from the earth, who is also the false prophet. These two will work in tandem, as they already work in tandem in secret for the destruction of Secret Babylon. And the ten horns, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate, and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. For God hath put in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled. (And so the horsemen will ride.)</p>
<p>They will rise offering peace, safety, and false godliness. They will outlaw anything to do with me, Jesus Christ, across the world, and they will make war with the saints and overcome them, for it is given in their hands to so accomplish. Their so-called aliens will present themselves and will offer their help to mankind, but these are fallen angels bringing great deception. Behold, I bring giants to fulfill my wrath, and so has Yahweh declared. As in the days of Noah, so shall it be for the fallen angels of old; even the so-called gods of old (they are no gods) will seek to rebuild their golden age on the earth, and they are released for judgment, but no golden age will they have. Their abominations will be released, for the restrainer will be gone and fully removed, and nothing shall hold them back. Those who love their lives will lose them eternally, for they will require the mark to participate in their new society, even their new order. And all who take the mark of the beast will have their portion in the lake of fire.</p>
<p>My 144,000 are not sent to live in their cities, where they would have to take the mark to live. But they will be sent to and fro and will gather many to them and care for many and will help bring great multitudes in salvation to me, Yeshua HaMashiach (in whatever language): all who will call on my name until the end shall be saved. God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. As in the days of Noah, those who are godly will live outside of their evil fallen-angel society, for theirs will be a society of sin that leads to eternal damnation in the unquenchable fires; so join them not because the choice is permanent. And so my 144,000 will bring salvation and help to many.</p>
<p>They will do mighty signs, miracles, and wonders, and I will lead them step by step, and I will direct their paths to those to whom I am sending them. And I will gather my sheep to them so they may be led to safety. And whosoever loves not their lives to the end will be saved. And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.</p>
<p>The beast from the sea will rise and will serve the evil purposes of those who rule the land of promise in great sin, even the synagogue of Satan. He will rule the nations and will speak many blasphemies, and will do great lying signs and wonders, and they worshiped the dragon which gave power unto the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? Who is able to make war with him? The synagogue of Satan will do all they can to destroy anyone who calls on my name, and the beast and the false prophet will brutally enforce Noahide on the nations and will appear as though they are cleansing evil from the land. But they will instead make war with the saints and overcome them, and it is given to the beast from the sea to continue 42 months.</p>
<p>The beast from the earth will rise also from the ashes. He will have all the power of the first beast, and he will do many lying signs and wonders in the sight of the first beast, and he will make an image of the beast, and a spirit will be permitted to cause the image of the beast to speak, saying that whoso will not bow down and worship the image of the first beast should be killed.</p>
<p>For the beast from the earth will they crown king of the lands of promise, and he will be their long-awaited Moshiach, and he will build their temple (even though Yahweh did not commission him), and so it will be. They will receive him as a great, benevolent ruler, prophet, and king. And the beast from the earth (even their false prophet) will cause all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads, And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. They have even conditioned the earth to accept the mark, and the system has been refined during their so-called pandemic.</p>
<p>(It is written in Revelation: And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receives the mark of his name.)</p>
<p>In the first 42 months, I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth. These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth. And if any man will hurt them, fire proceeds out of their mouth, and devours their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed. These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will. And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.</p>
<p>The beast from the earth, even their false prophet, will surely bring the abomination of desolation. He will cause the daily sacrifice to cease and set the abomination of desolation in their place. And so I stated and so Matthew wrote: When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place (whoso reads, let him understand), Then let them which be in Judea flee into the mountains: Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take anything out of his house: Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes. And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days! But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day: For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.</p>
<p>(Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.)</p>
<p>And so I will protect many and hide many away in the wilderness from the great tribulation, for had the days not been shortened, no flesh would survive. Then the beast and false prophet will gather the kings of the earth and all that stand with them from the dragons' kingdom for that great day of battle. And so I had John the Revelator write: And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it, he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treads the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.</p>
<p>And the beast and false prophet will both be taken alive and cast into the lake of fire burning with brimstone. And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh. And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshiped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.</p>
<p>And so my angel will descend from the heavens, having the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain with which he will bind Satan in the bottomless pit for a thousand years and set the seal so that he should deceive the nations no more for a thousand years. At the end of my thousand-year reign, Satan will be loosed from the abyss for a little season.</p>
<p>He will go out to deceive the nations in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog to gather them together as the sand of the sea, and he will attack the camp of saints and surround the holy city, and fire will come down from Yahweh and will utterly consume them. And the devil that deceived them will be bound and cast alive into that great lake of fire, which burns with brimstone in the hottest flames of blue. And there will be great recompense of evil and great justice will be served on the Satan's own head, his fallen angels, and all who joined their rebellion; and never again will they arise, and they will be utterly forgotten; and never again will they come to mind.</p>
<p>Then Yahweh will make a new heaven and a new earth, and he will make his abode among men, and in peace and harmony will it be forevermore, and never again will there be a time of trouble, and they shall never again sin, neither through pride nor ungodliness, and all their days will be blessed.</p>
<div class="indent">
<p>I am the resurrected Nazarene who died to sin once and who dies no more.</p>
<p>I am Yeshua, even your true Messiah, whom Yahweh has sent to fulfill the promises made to the Fathers.</p>
<p>I am he whose eyes are a flame of fire, and on my head many crowns.</p>
<p>I am Lord of Lords and King of Kings, and in righteousness I come to judge and make war.</p>
<p>I am he who will direct and lead my 144,000, and they will sing a new song that no man can learn.</p>
<p>I am he who will defeat Satan's kingdom, and I will bruise his head.</p>
<p>I am he whom Yahweh has sent for salvation of all who believe, and my time has come. Behold! Judgment comes and the times are now.</p>
