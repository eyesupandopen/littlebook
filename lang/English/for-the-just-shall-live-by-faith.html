<h1 id="ph">For the Just shall live by Faith!</h1>
<div id="prophecy">
<p>For the just shall live by faith! Awake, and awaken your brethren, my lukewarm Laodicean church, who has forgotten my mysteries; for the hour is late and time is almost up. Come to me, my children, with open arms and an open heart (for my arms and heart are open for you); come to me with a heart that is soft and ready to receive my words. For what did my brother James have to say? Wherefore lay apart all filthiness, and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls. My children, be ye followers of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and receive with meekness the engrafted Word, that I have placed in your midst that you may have eyes to see and ears to hear. Turn your hearts to me, for I am the way, the truth, and the life, and no one comes to the Father except through me, for so my Father's will is expressed plainly, and he has made it so.</p>
<p>Why do you let your hearts trouble you, my children? Why do you yet turn away from my words and lead others astray in your error? For you, my Laodicean church, have forgotten who you are in me, Christ Jesus, and you have lost my mysteries, though I entrusted them to you. For I am the Lord who purchased you with my own blood; I am the Lord of Lords and King of Kings who has inherited the earth from my Father, and I will share my inheritance with the faithful and chosen; I will share my inheritance with you, my Bride! So fear not, for though you are poor, you are rich in me, for the Father has given into my hands all things. Oh, Laodicean church, you have become a faithless woman of compromise.</p>
<p>No, you do not care for the meat of my word, and neither do you follow me with your whole heart; have you not read the Proverb? Good understanding wins favor, but the way of the faithless is difficult. And the ways of compromise you have chosen are difficult; your faithless ways are not of me, and you endeavor to walk the path I have given you with one foot in the way and the other in the ditch, and yet you have the audacity to blame me, Yeshua HaMashiach, when in the ditch you fall as you have been led. For your journey has many falls, and my hope for you yet is that your falls are as the falls of the just: For a just man falls seven times and rises up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.</p>
<p>I didn't call you to fall into mischief, my children, not even you, my Laodicean church, for I have not abandoned you to the times of trials just yet. For behold! I still stand at the door and knock because I will in no way partake of your lukewarm, compromising ways, but I am calling you to righteousness. I am calling you to take a stand in righteousness, for the wayward shepherds have conned you, leading you into the ways of Balaam; and many of you prophesy falsely by spirits of Jezebel, who would dilute my true prophets' words and desire to kill the prophets I have sanctified in me, for it is I who have given gifts unto men. For I have written to Galatia when they stumbled as you stumble: I marvel, that you are so soon removed from him, that called you into the grace of Christ, unto another Gospel: Which is not another. Yes, read that again, for there is no other Gospel and there is no other name given whereby men shall be saved except mine, Jesus Christ. Why are you led astray from me, my little ones? Do I not provide and care for you, for I am the good shepherd who gave his life for the sheep. But the words I have not spoken, that you passionately desire and follow, are tickling your ears; for that sensation has become your first love in your puffed up ways; for you treasure lies to yourselves as if they were truth, and you have lost all discernment.</p>
<p>Have you forgotten basic church history? Have you been too lazy to learn? Does this topic not tickle your ears enough for you to hear my words and have faith in them? For man shall not live by bread alone but by EVERY word that proceeds from the mouth of God! My church was born on the day of Pentecost and is recorded in Acts for your review. For my church began in Israel, in Judea, though they didn't understand the words I spoke by Peter on that glorious day when I poured out holy spirit on my chosen, as they spoke with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance! For what did Peter tell the crowd at Jerusalem that day when he prophesied for me? For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. My children, you are those who are far off, for many of you are not of Israel according to the flesh, but I have taken you from the nations in my grace that you should stand in my mercy, for you have been called.</p>
<p>Have you not read? But now in Christ Jesus, you who sometimes were far off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ. But in your compromised houses of worship that you blasphemously dedicate in my name (though I will not enter but stand at the door and knock), you think you have received the law of Moses from me, and in your arrogance you do not understand that Moses was of Israel, and it was to Israel that Torah was given to keep, a charge they failed; for no man is able to keep the law of Moses due to the corruption the serpent caused in your flesh, for his knowledge always corrupts, and the wages of sin is death. For the Corinthians bear witness of my words: Who also hath made us able ministers of the New Testament, not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life. You are called to walk in the spirit, though so many of you erroneously crave the letter of the law, which is not for you, but is fulfilled in me.</p>
<p>Answer me this: Did the spirit come to you by your own fulfillment of Torah? Or did it come by my righteous fulfillment of Torah as your perfect Passover? For what cries the witness of Galatia? This only would I learn of you, received ye the spirit, by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of faith? And again Paul says to the Galatians: I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the Law, then Christ is dead in vain. Do you not understand in the beginning of the age there was a Judean church and a Gentile church? Even though my church was birthed in Judea, Paul said to the Galatians and I preserved it there: For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the Apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me towards the Gentiles. For the first I sent Peter to the Gentiles, and it is recorded in Acts when I told Peter: What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common. For when I sent Peter to Cornelius, the following witness was recorded: And they of the circumcision which believed, were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the holy Ghost. I ask you this, my Laodiceans, did Cornelius receive salvation by following Torah (for he was a devout man)? Or did he receive the promise through faith? The Corinthians have a voice on the matter when Paul wrote to them: By which also you are saved, if you keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless you have believed in vain. Salvation came by the preaching of faith and not by the letter of the law, for to bring oneself under the law of Moses, even your faith is in vain.</p>
<p>And so Romans declares: But now the righteousness of God without the Law is manifested, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets. Even the righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all, and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God. For I told my church in Galatians where Paul obediently wrote: For in Jesus Christ, neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith which works by love. And again to Galatia Paul wrote: For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. So salvation is not given by the works of the law, nor is your salvation lived and realized by the works of the law. For to the Romans was written: Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling stone, and rock of offense: and whosoever believes on him, shall not be ashamed. My children, I am that stumbling stone and rock of offense, for I am Jesus the Nazarene, the very lamb of God, and I have fulfilled the law.</p>
<p>Oh, you of Laodicea, do you think you are the only ones to stumble on this matter? I say not. For you can group my letters loosely in two basic categories, except both are written to one new man in Christ Jesus. For my letters are written to the Gentile churches, and some are addressed to the Judean churches, and thus Peter wrote of the revelation of the Mystery which I revealed to Paul: As also in all his Epistles, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other Scriptures, unto their own destruction.</p>
<p>So your plight is not a new one, for there has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it. Will you take the path of escape that God has provided you in my grace and mercy to escape those who would rob you of your reward by causing you to fall from grace? Will you reject my words in favor of the Judaizers who ignorantly profess you must keep Torah for your salvation? Are you foolish enough to think that, having begun the law of life in the spirit of Jesus Christ, you are now given over to the law of sin and death? For what of the law? My children, I will tell you. Do not foolishly conclude that I am a false voice leading you into error, for many of you do not know my voice and neither do you know me, though I am calling you! Think not that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets. I have not come to destroy, but to fulfill. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one yod or thorn of a yod, shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</p>
<p>I am he who has fulfilled the Mosaic law, and its precepts are kept in obedience to my words of grace and mercy in my epistles and via the faith of Jesus Christ. You ignorantly think because I am the fulfillment of the law that I advocate anyone to break the laws of God, whether Mosaic law or God's moral laws. For what did I tell those dwelling at Corinth? My Laodicean church, whom I love, you are not the first to deal with this temptation, and thus I had Paul write: Who also hath made us able ministers of the New Testament, not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit gives life. But if the ministration of death written, and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses, for the glory of his countenance, which glory was to be done away: How shall not the ministration of the spirit, be rather glorious? Make no mistake, my children, the letter killeth because of the sin in your flesh that is convicted by that same letter, even the Mosaic law: So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good. Was that then which is good, made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good: that sin by the Commandment might become exceeding sinful. And so I had Paul tell the Galatians: I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the Law, then Christ is dead in vain. My children, you have been led astray, and I did tell you that new wine must be put into new wineskins, so stand fast in the grace whereby I, Christ Jesus, have made you free.</p>
<p>My children, you cannot violate God's laws when you walk in the spirit, for it is impossible. You are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone. And to the Hebrews was stated: For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more. In that he saith, a new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decays and waxes old is ready to vanish away. My children, righteousness does not come by keeping the law, for it is a gift received by faith in me, Christ Jesus. And because you are made righteous in me, you are freed from the law of sin and death.</p>
<p>For it is blasphemous to conclude that walking in the spirit of life is somehow sinful, for anyone who believes such counts my sacrifice for the sins of man an unholy thing. For I am greater than Moses, for Moses himself says: The Lord thy God will raise up unto you a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me, unto him ye shall hearken. Hear my voice, children, and hearken to my speech, for I have not made you lawless, for the sons of Satan are lawless, not the sons of God! For in Romans Paul clearly wrote: There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit. For the law of the spirit of life, in Christ Jesus, hath made me free from the law of sin and death.</p>
<p>For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son, in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin condemned sin in the flesh: That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit. And again Romans speaks: To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believes in Jesus. Where is boasting, then? It is excluded. By what Law? Of works? Nay: but by the Law of faith. Therefore, we conclude, that a man is justified by faith, without the deeds of the Law. For what have I said: For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</p>
<p>Yet so many of you place undue burdens on one another in that you have believed the prophets of Satan who are sent to snare you into falsely keeping Torah as a requirement of salvation and also to live salvation; and some of you blasphemously say that I fulfilled the law by my sacrifice of myself so that you could now keep Torah. On one hand, you are correct, because to walk in the law of the spirit of life is to keep Torah perfectly by your identification with me; for my church is firmly built in righteousness and true holiness on me, Christ Jesus, the chief cornerstone. You do keep Torah by obedience to the faith that is in me. Why do you choose the voice of the Judaizers over my own holy voice? Why do you place undue burdens on your brethren, for have you not read? For I already told the Colossians: Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of any Holy day, or of the New moon, or of the Sabbath days Which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ.</p>
<p>My children, I do not condemn the law; I only point out the obvious that because of the sin in your flesh you can never keep Torah except by your faith in me, for the just shall live by faith! What is faith in me, you may ask? Faith in me is built on trusting my words and understanding that you are identified with me on every level, for you are my church that I have washed in my own sinless blood; for remission of sins is impossible to achieve by the sacrifice of animals. Have faith in me, for through faith in me is Torah kept, through faith in me the law is fulfilled in you, and you are righteous, justified, and sanctified! When I was raised to newness of life, so too were you raised; and when I was ascended to the right hand of the Father, so too were you seated in the heavenlies. For the Ephesians do witness: But God who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ (by grace ye are saved), And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. You should understand that the law of Moses is simply not your covenant, for yours is the new covenant ratified in my blood and paid for by my suffering.</p>
<p>So be obedient to the Faith, my people, and be lukewarm no longer. Choose life in me, Jesus Christ, for so were you called. Do the many mighty works I have given you, even in this last minute. I need you to understand that without me, you can do nothing, and you keep all aspects of Torah by faith in me. Furthermore, the sacred-named Judaizers have saturated my church, placing undue burdens on those who seek salvation and those who are mine. My Father gave me a name above every name, that at the name of Jesus Christ should every knee bow. Do you think I would place an undue burden on the nations who speak many languages to use my name, Yeshua HaMashiach, in Hebrew only? Hear me and hear me well, for I am coming, and I will deal with the disobedient and those who would trouble you.</p>
