<h1 id="ph">Sinners! Come To Me in This Last Time!</h1>
<div id="prophecy">
<p>Hear my Words, even the Words of Jesus the Nazarene, for I am coming to you in the spirit of love, compassion, humility, grace, and especially mercy. For soon my grace and mercy will be replaced with great trouble, even Jacob's trouble, and this entire seven-year period will be unlike anything the earth has ever seen, even since the beginning of creation. It will begin with sudden destruction and persecution that will only intensify. Therefore, I come this last time to the sinners who have not yet repented in my grace and mercy. For there is still but a moment left for your repentance if you will come to me, Jesus Christ, and confess me as your Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised me from the dead. I have outstretched my arms in grace and mercy to a dying world for an entire age of grace now, and many have made me their Lord, even as many as the Lord our God has called and chosen from before the foundations of the world to be revealed in me, Jesus Christ the mighty Lord: For I am Lord of Lords and King of Kings.</p>
<p>And I have called the chosen, and all who have become faithful in my salvation. Many have been saved! Saved from what, you ask? Saved from the judgment and destruction that is about to be unleashed on this world, its gods, its rulers, its principalities, and all who follow Satan, for he is the god of this world and his judgment has come. Even saved from the great white throne judgment and the lake of fire prepared for the Devil and his angels. Judgment has been passed on the rulers of this present darkness, and it is soon coming to consummation and completion, for the earth will be ruled by my hand in righteousness, for my time has come to be revealed, and the earth is mine and the fullness thereof, even I, Yeshua HaMashiach!</p>
<p>Judgment is coming and is even here but not yet in full. And so many of you still believe you have time to indulge your sins and seek satisfaction for your sinful lusts which come from your corrupted flesh. Understand that I have no desire to judge and condemn any of you, for I have given my life in my love for you and in full payment for your sins in great agony and torment on the cross! For there is not one sin that has not been paid fully by my atoning sacrifice as the perfect Passover. I am the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. And I didn't come to condemn you, but I am here to save you. The world as you know it is about to change so drastically that you will not recognize what will rise from the ashes, for much of the world is about to go down in flames and perish in a multitude of ways in Yahweh's righteous judgment. And great horror is coming out of these ashes.</p>
<p>For the prince of this world is judged, and his judgment will be fulfilled and consummated fully. For much evil has Satan done and his ways are deplorable, and he only comes to steal, kill, and destroy. He has corrupted mankind fully and in various ways, and he seeks to destroy all that God loves. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in me should not perish, but have everlasting life. So understand fully that I am the final Passover lamb for all time (there will not be another), and I have paid for all sins. Satan has corrupted the genetics of mankind since the garden of Eden, when he tempted Adam and Eve to accept his putrid fruit and believe his worthless knowledge, for his knowledge brings death to all who eat thereof. And for this reason God Almighty has offered a peace treaty to his creation, even me, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>For what says the voice of the Ephesians, when Paul wrote them concerning my completed works (for I said in my final breath on the cross, "It is finished")! But now, in Christ Jesus, you which a while ago were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.</p>
<p>For he is our peace, which has made of both one, and has broken down the wall that was a stop between us. Hear my voice. I am your peace, for the law condemned sin in the flesh; even your own flesh and blood is corrupted in sin, even contaminated since Eden. I, Jesus Christ, in my atoning sacrifice on Calvary have broken down the middle wall of partition between Jew and Gentile, making them both one new man, even re-created them in righteousness and true holiness for all who accept peace by declaring me as their risen Lord!</p>
<p>But there is more from the Ephesians (as if this isn't wonderful enough), so Ephesians continues: and hath also put away through his flesh the cause of hatred (that is to say, the law of commandment contained in the law written) for to make of two one new man in himself, so making peace: and to reconcile both unto God in one body through his cross, and slew hatred thereby. Hear me, oh man who has refused my call: I am calling you now in these last seconds, and time is almost up! Accept me as your peace offering, for I am freely offering you salvation and redemption from your corrupted bodies, even eternal life in me, Christ Jesus. Make no mistake: Every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</p>
<p>Hear my voice and understand that anything good in your lives, anything of value and virtue, is of the Father and given by the Father of Lights so that you may have fullness of life and come to me, the Lord Jesus, as your personal savior. And that you may know there is life eternal for you if you but accept. Do you hate yourselves so much that you are willing to sacrifice everything you love in life that has been given from the Father to satisfy your own selfish lusts? Are your sins so important to you that you will choose everlasting condemnation with Satan over the goodness of God and newness of life in me, Christ Jesus? Are your sins that important to you?</p>
<p>I am calling you, oh natural man, and I am inviting you to peace and eternal life, a life free from sickness and sin, even a life free of disease and heartbreak, a life free from suffering where you will no longer watch those you love suffer; for the former things will pass away so very soon. There is no more time to satisfy your sins. For so many of you have taken the grace of God in vain and believed the lies of the thief, who wants to steal your very lives from you so you may join him in his eternal punishment. Make no mistake. To reject me, Jesus the Nazarene (even he who gave himself for your sins and salvation), is to reject life and choose eternally the second death of which Satan and his angels are condemned: For they have no forgiveness, and they will have no rest, and they have no peace. And the lake of fire is prepared for the Devil and his angels.</p>
<p>To reject my sacrifice is to reject eternal life and to reject God fully. Therefore, there will be no mercy, grace, love, light, nor peace but only regret, darkness, and torment where you will reap the putrid fruit of your flesh for all eternity. Do you not see how foolish this is? I have paid for your sins in my atoning blood! But you refuse my ways, though I am calling you right now and for many the last time. You refuse my love, though my heart still breaks for you and your families, and I would save you to the uttermost if you only repent and cease from your sins. Do you not understand that I suffered as the lowest sinner in my atoning sacrifice that I might lift you up to God in salvation? For I was lifted up on the cross to save your souls and reconcile you to the Father, and I have always been sinless, so accept my sinless blood!</p>
<p>For what says Scripture? For surely you have heard that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son: that whosoever believes in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life. I know these words are familiar to you, for even your entertainers who keep you in bondage to Satan have blasphemously misapplied my words. But you would do well to keep reading, so please hear my voice! For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world: but that the world through him might be saved. He that believes on him, is not condemned: but he that believes not, is condemned already, because he has not believed in the Name of the only begotten Son of God.</p>
<p>Is my speech not plain enough? Are my words not easily understood? If you reject me, the Lord Jesus, the Lamb of God, you will permanently join my enemy, even those who are responsible for spilling the innocent blood: For to reject me is to join Satan's rebellion, for the Devil has sinned from the beginning. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. And so is the truth concerning you, oh natural man, even those of you who would reject my spirit of life, and for all this I am still calling you, though this is the last and final call before judgment begins. For there is no more time. Are your sins that important to you that you would spend eternity in outer darkness and punishment in that great lake of fire prepared for the Devil and his angels? For God does not desire this punishment for you and has sent me as his peace offering to reconcile you to him by my atoning blood.</p>
<p>Hear my words and accept my peace. To all those who hear these words, know that I, Jesus the Nazarene, am calling you; and I don't care what sins bind you because I have paid for them all. Understand that taking the mark of the beast will be unforgivable, and I am trying to save you from this temptation (even though the mark is not here just yet); for many will lose their lives in torment for refusing. But understand the following: You cannot get so low that I cannot reach you; only take not the mark. Not even the haughty can elevate themselves in sin so highly that I cannot bring them gently down to salvation and seal them with my spirit that I may exalt them! For I have paid for all sins of mankind for all time, and I left nothing undone. There are so many sins, but I will call some of you specifically by your vices. Know that I will forgive all your sins and not just these, and I will fully cleanse you in my blood from all of your sins.</p>
<p>To the alcoholic and drug addict, I say: Turn to me now in an eternal moment of clarity and hear my words, for if you will listen in faith, my words will bring the glorious light of salvation to you. My words will bind the demons who make you drink and use drugs, though you would make them your friends. I give you miraculous clarity so you can decide which you will have for eternity: Eternal life with me, Jesus Christ, in perfect union with God himself? Or eternal damnation in the fires that are never quenched? Is the sin you greedily hold in your hand, even your alcohol and drug addiction, so important that you would choose to perish, even inflicting your fate on those you love who follow you instead of me?</p>
<p>You are not so low that I cannot lift you up, and I so passionately desire to forgive you, but you have to respond to my voice and come out of your ways in repentance. Pour out your alcohol and quit poisoning yourselves, and come to me in repentance, and I will deliver you. There is no time to waste; don't ignore me and spiral off into drunkenness and forget my words, for your own words of rejection will be recorded in the heavens as a witness against you on the day of judgment, and you will not escape!</p>
<p>To the murderer, I say: Immediately stop your murderous violence of those who are made in the image of God, even your fellow man, for this is grave sin. Verily, and truly of an unalterable truth, you have murdered your own selves with every life you have taken, and without me there is no remedy to your coming punishment. But even your murders were paid in full in my sacrifice, for I left nothing undone. I have demonstrated my grace in the life of the great Apostle Paul as a witness of encouragement, oh you murderers.</p>
<p>For even Saul was deceived and headed toward great judgment on the road to Damascus, where I saved him from himself. Paul persecuted, hurt, and consented to and committed murder against my holy Church! For he admits as much in Acts: And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prison both men and women. Yet he accepted my offer of eternal life and made me, Jesus Christ, his Lord and faithfully served me as an example of repentance to all, and I highly elevated him for his obedience. I have paid for your murderous ways if you will repent from them and come to me in true repentance, for if you do so now, I will receive you in grace and mercy. Do not be deceived; there is no time to waste.</p>
<p>To the lowest of the low, I say: I have even made a way for you to come out of your insanity and confusion, for I have given you over to your vile lusts just as Romans declares: For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one towards another, men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet.</p>
<p>Come out of your uncleanness, and come out of your worthless pride, and quit blaspheming the sign given to Noah and to every living creature, even the rainbow that shows itself in the rain clouds. The rainbow is for the world to know that God will never destroy the world by water again, though judgment by fire is imminent. Come to me and repent, change your ways and call on my name, confess me as Lord from a heart filled with faith in my resurrection, and I will receive you. Hurry! For you don't have time to ponder, for judgment is about to be unleashed. There is no time to waste.</p>
<p>Hear my words and come to me, for I have no pleasure in the coming judgment and destruction, and neither does Yahweh, no, not even God Almighty! For Adam was created in the Father's love and perfection in righteousness and true holiness. God gave him a life complete with nothing lacking. And so Satan attacked the creation and corrupted your very flesh and your very nature so that you go astray from the womb, for sin is in your blood: The life of the flesh is in the blood. Yet God, in his great mercy, for his mercy endures forever, even God Almighty gave me, his only begotten son, as the perfect sacrifice that will save you to the uttermost if you will only come to me in repentance from your sins. I will undo the works of Satan in your lives if you will come to me. Please come, for my arms will not be outstretched much longer!</p>
<p>There is so little time remaining, and Jacob's trouble is about to break forth across the earth, and men's hearts will fail them for the severity of what is coming. Satan has prepared many abominations that he will unleash, for to refuse my call is to choose Satan's kingdom of death and destruction; and I will leave you to your choice, and I will give you the darkness and misery you so love, and you will eat of the fruit of your ways unless you repent. For this is it, this is the last call before judgment swiftly comes. Even my servants and ministers cry to the ends of the earth this very second, except they will cry for your salvation until they are snatched away to me in the clouds when I come for my bride in the air shortly, and this will happen unexpectedly, though I tell you plainly before it happens. And then my last call of grace and mercy will be over. And when I snatch my bride to safety, sudden destruction will break across the earth, and many of you who hear these words will not escape. Some of you foolishly think you can continue to abuse my grace and it will continue indefinitely, but the sad truth is that grace will turn to judgment, and it will happen suddenly, and many will not escape.</p>
<p>For those who are not killed by this sudden destruction soon to be unleashed on Mystery Babylon will find themselves in a world they never dreamed possible, a world where there is constant death and destruction, for Satan will systematically purge anything to do with me, Jesus Christ, and he will do it unmercifully. There will be torment across the land and wanton cruelty, and to come to me during this time of judgment and testing will be the most difficult; but whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved, and they will have to endure to the end, and many will lose their heads, and many will die in great torment.</p>
<p>But even then, God will wipe away all tears from their eyes, for John the Revelator declared concerning them: These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore, are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his Temple: and he that sitteth on the Throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore, neither shall the Sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them unto the living fountain of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.</p>
<p>I, even I, Christ Jesus, the risen and ascended Lord, even the true Messiah: I am calling you, and my hope and expectation is that you will accept my peace offering and come to my salvation that you may live eternally with me in the bosom of the Father! Only refuse not my call, for I will not call much longer, and I will not call in grace and mercy in this manner again, for time is out (though grace and mercy are forever with me). Please come to me that I may save you in these last seconds of grace. For you are no different from those who believed at the start of my age of grace, and my salvation and reward will be yours if you obey my voice right now. Right now is the time of salvation! Repent and come to me in humility. Make me your Lord and know that I am alive forevermore, for God raised me from the dead to die no more. Should you accept my offer, you will have overcome, and you will receive the rewards of the overcomer:</p>
<p>Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hears my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. To him that overcometh, will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne. Read this again and again, for I am offering you a last shot at salvation by grace. Only do not refuse my call, for there is no more time for such things. For so many of you, rejection of me will be final and permanent, and you will not recover nor escape the coming judgment, for sudden destruction is on you. And the Spirit and the Bride say, come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is thirsty, come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.</p>
<p>And finally: He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still. And behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be. So let it be done.</p>
