<div id="prophecy">
<h2>From Yeshua HaMashiach:</h2>
<p>My son, if thou will receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee; so that you incline your ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding. Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness: and know that I, the Lord Jesus Christ, am ever with you and am ever present in your lives as you hold on to me and my salvation, for I am the head of the Body, and I am your faithful Lord, my beloved Bride. For I have prepared a place and future for you, and there is great reward for my called, and faithful, and chosen.</p>
<p>I have not called you to loss and punishment nor have I called you to shame and self-condemnation; have you not read there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit? So believe my words! I did not call you to live in the shadow of your past sins, nor to live in the shadow of your youthful exploits, but I have called you to die to your old sinful ways and take up newness of life in me as you put off your flesh, as you put off your sins and walk in newness of life in me. Behold! I make all things new! Is this not your hope?</p>
<p>My children, I have taken you from the depravity of this current dying world, and I have delivered you from the power of darkness and have translated you into my kingdom, the kingdom of God, led by me, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, of which Yahweh is God, for there is no other. I have called you to glory and virtue in me, and I have rescued you from the kingdom of Satan, the kingdom of darkness, into my Kingdom, where there is light! So, awake you who sleeps, and arise from the dead, and I, Jesus Christ, will give you light.</p>
<p>Have you not read in the letters I sent to my Bride, that I sent to you, my very Church? Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</p>
<p>Do you not understand my precepts, oh, lukewarm church of Laodicea? I did not call you to return to your flesh, nor did I call you to continue in your unrighteous ways. Think, and consider; let him that thinks he stands, take heed lest he fall! Take heed to yourselves, and to the doctrine: continue in them: for in doing this, thou shalt both save yourself, and them that hear you. Understand, my lukewarm little ones, that you cannot live a life of compromise between good and evil, thinking you are upright before me, when you choose the lesser of two evils in your election rituals that I do not condone or endorse.</p>
<p>Come out of her, my people, as I have NOT provided a political solution, and I have absolutely not given you a world leader to make anything great again. You are deceived, and you are being primed to follow and give consent to the son of perdition who openly walks among you, although he has not been revealed quite yet. But you who ask for discernment will know who he is, so that you may avoid his deception. No, compromise is not for you, as you are my children and brethren, and I did not win your salvation by giving my life as a ransom for many by compromising with Satan; for to compromise is to join their ranks. So make no mistake: You either stand for me in righteousness and true holiness, or you have joined the ranks of Satan in his dying kingdom, so REPENT!</p>
<p>What do you gain by compromise with evil? Do you not understand that you are to overcome evil with good? So stand fast in me and quit flip-flopping like a fish out of water. Many of you are still blown about by every wind of doctrine and sleight of hand, whereby they lie in wait to deceive. I, Christ Jesus, have spoken, and I will not be silenced. So many of you have compromised yourselves and my church, and I ask you: how long halt you between two opinions? If the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. Simply stated, you cannot compromise and choose any form of evil and think you are standing for me; when you choose evil, you choose the sources of that evil as your lord and master becoming the servant of sin. Know ye not, that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey: whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</p>
<p>Hear me and hear me well, my Church; know that I stand in disgust at the practices that are prevalent in your nation and around the world, that you have compromised and allowed into my Church to vex my little ones. As in the days of Noah, so shall it be. The days of Noah were a time when the earth was ruled by evil abominations made by the fallen angels, their very own seed, a seed of evil made for your complete destruction: and they will return, for behold, I bring giants to fulfill my wrath. They accomplished this by removing and violating natural boundaries that my Father set in place so that peace and righteousness could prevail, but by removing and immorally crossing the very boundaries that are obvious in nature itself, that my Father instituted, many of you have polluted yourselves by your consent of the evil prevalent in your times. The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be: and that which is done, is that which shall be done; and there is no new thing under the sun. Have you not read, oh, ye of little faith? Removing God's own boundaries causes insanity, and sickness, and confusion of all things. Many of you revel in mental illness, thinking a man can become a woman and a woman can become a man, and you lead your own children into your delusions. Many of you attend churches led by homosexual false ministers who are open and flamboyant in their sickness, and you think they speak for me? Know this: if you are in that sinful state, I will give you over to the lusts you so wantonly crave, and you will reap the fruit of your unclean ways.</p>
<p>Behold! For this cause, God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one towards another, men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet. But no, it is not enough to be led by the effeminate and their lies; you allow your own children to be compromised and even mutilated before me.</p>
<p>There is great consequence in store for these actions, and they will not go unpunished. And yet you persist in your insanity, and unless you repent, I will spew you out of my mouth. Come to me in repentance, and sit in sackcloth and ashes, that I may know the sincerity of your repentance and weep and howl over your sins so that you do not pay the price in judgment. So many of you are so arrogant because you try to make me Lord while you still have a faithless heart, for with the heart man believes unto righteousness. So have faith that you may be saved; your faith will be indicated to all by your repudiation of sin and coming out of your filthy ways. The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted. But you still consent to the ways of the sodomite, and you help bring great evil on the land, to the point that you actually vote for child molesters to lead your lands. You lack even the most elementary level of discernment, and you do not follow my way; and if you persist, I will completely give you over to your vile affections for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved.</p>
<p>Let me open your eyes, you who are willingly ignorant and blind, you who sit in filth and darkness, rolling in the mire. You cannot give your consent to evil and think you are serving me, for I resisted evil and temptation until the very last drop of blood flowed from me onto the red earth, for I am the last Adam and I have been made a quickening spirit. So many of you are blinded by good words and fair speeches and give your full consent to criminals and horrible people who prey on children. They molest children, they torture children for their own evil lusts: For so comes the wrath of God on Mystery Babylon, but so many of you persist in giving your consent to these brute beasts who are set aside for the eternal hellfires that will never be quenched. Come out of her, my people, or you will share in her plagues and the awful judgment that is coming on her; and I have warned you. For what concord has Christ with Belial? If you share in her lies, you will share in her plagues; so completely separate yourselves in word and in deed, and do not agree with them in the least. Do not live careless, compromised lives; for I will punish all who do. You think because you have eternal life that you can't experience great loss and consequence? I will strip your rewards and give them away, and you will be the least in the kingdom of heaven if you persist, for so says Yeshua HaMashiach, the Bridegroom, to my Bride!</p>
<h2>From Yahweh, the Great Eternal God: </h2>
<p>Oh, you worthless ones who harm my creation, you worthless ones who have sold yourselves to Satan, you worthless ones who have made Satan your God, you worthless ones who reject my son Jesus Christ and the salvation I have provided in his name, you worthless ones who have allowed your own children to burn in the fires of Moloch. I will give you the world you desire, and I have prepared you a world without me, a world without my son Christ Jesus, a world with a great lake of fire and brimstone just for you.</p>
<p>I will give you the darkness you so desire, for my light will not be present there, and you will spend eternity separated from me, Yahweh, the great brilliant God, whose glory and brightness no flesh can behold and who is from everlasting to everlasting. You rebellious, evil ones who have destroyed my creation from the beginning in your lusts and hate and jealousy, know that you have heaped great punishment and torment to yourselves from which you will never be healed and to all who are led astray by your lies and refusing Jesus Christ, refusing to turn from your lies to my truth.</p>
<p>You think that perverting my ways and removing my boundaries is a light thing, but you will understand my wrath as soon as the first flame touches you, and you will be engulfed in fire and brimstone of which you will never escape. Furthermore, you have murdered, raped, plundered, molested, hurt, killed, destroyed, and participated in the most grievous offenses, even desiring strange flesh; and you have joined yourselves to the fallen angels, so I will join you to the lake of fire that I have prepared for the Devil and his angels, and you will not escape. You have no peace.</p>
<p>I will exact justice on you, for I am a God of justice, and I am a God of vengeance. Yet, you will arrogantly stand against me, pleading your case, thinking that I will somehow shrink from your satanic ways of: do what you will, shall be the whole of the law. You have no peace. I will repay, and you say that I am a loving God (which I am), but then you expect me not to exact justice on those who have polluted my creation, on those who tortured and killed my only begotten son as he gave himself a ransom for all; yea, you expect me not to exact justice on you for your worthless ways when you have killed, tortured, and maimed the innocent and you have starved my little ones for your own agendas.</p>
<p>Indeed, Satan himself would destroy all that is of me for his own greedy gain, and even then you try and accuse me of folly in my righteous judgments when I come to protect my own. Your days of leading my little ones astray are about to come to an end. Behold! Your beast and false prophet will utterly be destroyed, and I will cast them alive into that great lake burning with fire and brimstone; they will wait for you to join them in your inheritance.</p>
<p>Great judgment is on you, oh, prince of darkness; your kingdom and all that follow you are about to be utterly destroyed. For you are no gods, and you cannot deliver your worthless selves from my hand, and I will chain you in the deepest darkness that you so desire, even the deepest abyss will I chain you with a great chain that you cannot break. Yea, in the abyss you will be for one day, for one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. And even then I will loose you for a little season that you may tempt and gather the very last of those abominable ones who would follow you and your ways. And I will then consume all of you with fire, and the thrones of judgment will be set, and I will judge all of you evildoers, and you will go to everlasting punishment from the face of the Lord. You will burn in the presence of the angels and in the presence of the lamb, and they will behold you in torment and punishment, for you have wronged them all, and you will fully pay for your sins for all eternity.</p>
<p>Then you will be sealed in your prison, and you will be forgotten, and you will never again come to mind, for the former things will pass away and be forgotten. For behold, I will make a new heaven and new earth wherein dwells righteous; and I, Yahweh, the great eternal God of all gods, for there is none like me, behold, I will make all things new, for I, Yahweh have spoken it! Yahweh, the great eternal God, will make his throne on earth, and my dwelling place will be amongst men, and you will never again be, oh, you worthless ones, and you will forever burn in your forgotten prison of torment that you can never escape, for I will set the seal and none can break it.</p>
<p>Yet, so many of you who sympathize with Satan accuse me of folly for taking justice and vengeance into my own hands to deliver those who made themselves worthy of everlasting punishment to the flames. Hear my words, oh, dwellers of the earth: my Son is coming, and he comes with great vengeance, anger, and fury for the wrongs done by your hands. The times of judgment, even the judgment of the great day of Christ is about to explode across the earth, and there will be no remedy for the evil ones, no remedy for Satan, and no remedy for all who have joined him, as all will go into eternal perdition, and I will give back to them all that they have inflicted on the innocent.</p>
<p>Therefore, I will inflict their evil hearts' desires and all their evil works right back on them for all eternity. See my anger boiling and know that the times of restitution of all things is at hand, and no numbers are left on the clocks in the heavens, for all the numbers have fallen from the clock face, for time is up! I counsel all who read these words to run to my son Jesus Christ in repentance and make him Lord; for no one will come to me except through Jesus Christ, for no other name have I given for salvation, and all of your idols will burn. There is time yet for salvation, and whosoever calls on the name of the Lord to the end will be saved. So run to Jesus Christ while you still can, for the day of the Lord has come, and I will unleash my Son, and the wrath of the Lamb will be satisfied. Kiss the Son lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little: Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.</p>
