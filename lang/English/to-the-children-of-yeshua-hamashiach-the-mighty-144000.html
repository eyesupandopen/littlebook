<h1 id="ph">To The Children Of Yeshua HaMashiach, The Mighty 144,000: I Reveal You NOW</h1>
<div id="prophecy">
<p>Hear Hear the Words of Yeshua HaMashiach as you are taken into the heavens in your Season of NOW!</p>
<p>Hear Hear the Words of Yeshua HaMashiach as I come to tell my church, my body and even my bride, (who are my 144,000 even all you adopted children of your Father Yeshua HaMashiach) that you have been created and made by the full artistry of Adonai-YHVH Himself and you are all his masterpieces even all you faithful in Christ Jesus called from before the foundations of the world!</p>
<p>Hear Hear the Words of Yeshua HaMashiach to understand that I have personally raised all of you 144,000 as children to myself, therefore hear my Words and understand yourselves, my children. For truly truly, there are no creations like you are to be made so suddenly and unexpectedly now, never ever in anyplace ever in all of El Shaddai's creation, truly you are unique.</p>
<p>Therefore hear my Words and understand their resonant authority, that I have prepared these Words from that open little book that I have opened in my messenger and servant's hand so that all of you 144,000 would now begin to understand your true selves and purposes that are partially revealed yet mostly concealed for you in the heavens to be revealed at convergence which has come over the entire earth NOW, into which season of NOW the earth is NOW suspended!</p>
<p>Because I did have Biblaridion:144 raise his hands in proclamation and declaration that time shall be no more, and so it NOW is in great power and authority given into and released by my mighty messenger and servant. Selah.</p>
<p>And so it is that I had one of my mighty 144,000, even one of my daughters whom I have raised and love greatly, who are of the 144,000 (because you all will be made one new man where there is neither male nor female and neither bond nor free): Therefore, I worked mightily in this chosen vessel of mine by way of the spirit of prophecy that I have placed upon her and this because she has taken my war scroll that I have opened in the hands of my little book, even Biblaridion:144 because he is little book, and she has prophesied as I worked mightily in her and led her hands exactly as I intended! To then be prophesied over by these Words of resonant authority now released into the earth at my command by Biblaridion:144 that will absolutely find the eyes, ears, and hearts of all those to whom they are sent!</p>
<p>And it is by this message that I have now compiled and decoded for my children directly. But also that all the faithful in Christ Jesus would begin to understand the magnitude of what you are to be changed NOW, and to what purposes and to what ends.</p>
<p>YOU ARE MY MIGHTY WARRIORS! EVEN ALL YOU 144,000!</p>
<p>Therefore, hear my Words that I now release by my messenger and servant in full power and authority that I have supplied for him to release in great power at my command, so that my true Bride, even my true 144,000 would be fully separated from these false prophetess Jezebels who have risen up and been empowered by Heylel Ben Shachar himself to peep and mutter and to confuse you with false words that will only ever lead you astray should you listen.</p>
<p>Therefore, look only to me, Yeshua HaMashiach, because I have only called my 144,000 by this open little book that I have opened in my messenger and servants hand. Therefore, understand my true prophets (whether they have read this open little book or not) all prophecy in unison and according to my EXACT Words, so compare and understand that you fall not to the right nor to the left, but that your feet remain on that straight and narrow: This is the Way, walk you in it!</p>
<p>Therefore, should any person prophesy not according exactly to these Words understand that I have not sent them, nor do they speak my Words and you shall not respect them! No matter the lost sheep led astray: that go forth: and are skipping with another jesus into the refiners fire by these false words of these Jezebels who only lead astray.</p>
<p>Hear my words and understand my speech so you may identify and avoid fully all who are sent for your destruction and who fully intend to lead you astray as they merchandise you for filthy lucre. Understand that these Words repeat and are to be read and understood and announced as I lead my little flock and work mightily in All you 144,000.</p>
<p>Therefore, Stand for me and obey my spirit of prophecy for it is the testimony of Jesus Christ, and no other scriptural Testimony of Jesus Christ is to be given into the earth except by Biblaridion:144 until the time of my two witnesses testimony that has come upon the entire earth now in full resonant authority and full expectation, although my many prophets speak in great power and also in unison with my open little book should they remain obedient to Christ Jesus. Selah!</p>
<p>And so I give you to understand that these scriptural Words are now compiled and released in testimony and seamlessly carry testimony from both Adonai-YHVH from whom all things proceed, into the full open face of Yeshua HaMashiach who always perfectly does the will of my Adonai-YHVH.</p>
<p>Therefore, understand that of the faithful in Christ Jesus there are the 144,000 who are the set apart children of their Father Yeshua HaMashiach who has raised them directly as a Father to each of them personally. Then there are the Children of Adonai-YHVH taken from the Sons of Adam and Israel alike to fill a double inheritance both of Heavenly reward and also earthly inheritance and reward at the hands of Christ Jesus whom they serve in his Body, and all overcomers from both groups will absolutely inherit all things according as their faithfulness and perseverance has been.</p>
<p>Your full reward is gathered, given, and rests in my hand for all of you NOW.</p>
<p>So that you may understand the intent of my heart for you all given in me by my Adonai-YHVH, that always perfectly does and reflects the will of Adonai-YHVH in all things perfectly and in everything. So that all my faithful in Christ Jesus will now be fully redeemed from the hands of their enemies and rewarded eternally and lavishly for all that you have overcome at my command in your lives on this earth which NOW on earth are NOT.</p>
<p>Accordingly, you all will be taken into the safety of the heavens immediately, so suddenly and unexpectedly NOW.</p>
<p>Then, you all will be presented to Adonai-YHVH without stain, spot, blemish, or wrinkle or any such thing perfectly clean and clothed in the finest white linen never to be corrupted by sin in the least eternally and forevermore. Even which things are to be done away in an eternal season of Righteousness where your Adonai-YHVH will be all in all and forever amongst his children that HE may rest from his labors.</p>
<p>Not that the eternal Adonai-YHVH would tire, or fatigue, or faint in his duties in your care and redemption and recreation by my command, but that you all may be finished from this 6 day refinement for disobedient Adam on the earth given as mercy by Elohim so you all may be strengthened and learn obedience to Yeshua HaMashiach who is also Christ Jesus (who is the only way to Adonai-YHVH) by serving at the hand of your enemies. That you may come to appreciate what is freely given by hand of Adonai-YHVH which is powerful, unending, and mightier than you can fathom, yet in your fallen, sinful natural, yet sanctified state you are unable to be endowed in full as intended. Therefore, you are sealed and redeemed by my holy spirit of promise, wherewith I have sealed my down payment of my purchased possession, and you are NOW readied for departure.</p>
<p>And so NOW, just as you arrive, I will tell you about your purposes in part that are still concealed from you until you are changed. Then your true power and might and intents and purposes will be revealed in full in the Heavens in the twinkling of an eye. That my 144,000 are given to Yeshua HaMashiach as my eternal children for familial purposes because you will forever more be with me directly and part of my household as fully inherited heirs of all things given in my hands for you. For purposes of vengeance so that you may do all I command you to mightily do. For purposes of scroll warfare, to forcibly seize with violent and unmerciful judgmental force the earth from the hands of these squatters that you may cleanse the earth at my command and so the meek shall inherit the earth.</p>
<p>My 144,000 are also purposes of guardianship and custodial care of Adonai-YHVH's creation forevermore in all things at my command. All of you 144,000 will be made invincible to all within Adonai-YHVH creation except to Christ Jesus and Adonai-YHVH. You all are immediately to be sealed in your foreheads in the Heavens with the seal of Adonai-YHVH. You will then enter covenant with your Father Yeshua who will then fully empower you all according to my purposes full of splendor and full power and authority and might.</p>
<p>Then my 144,000 will be released into the earth at my command during the wrath of the lamb, to do battle, and to gather, and to heal, and to cleanse the earth in righteous judgments for the salvation of those who will reject the mark of the beast so they may be readied for survival, or strengthened for martyrdom. Because many will be given the chance to call on the name of Jesus until their end and I will never leave them nor forsake them. My mighty 144,000 will serve and minister to them, doing mightier works on the earth that even Jesus the Nazarene did when I walked openly in my day.</p>
<p>Yet, I have promised you all in covenantal details of my New Testament that for those who are committed to Christ Jesus, and I to them that I will never leave you even though you are amongst the unfaithful in Christ, nor forsake you, even though you may not enter the Heavens at this time. Nevertheless, I will send my mighty 144,000 directly into this wasteland of Secret Babylon as these lands descend into total desolation where there is nothing but hell on earth. Where the contents of the abyss and all therein will be released onto the face of the earth from underneath the United States, across all continents through insertion points long established, and from beyond the ice because it will NOW fall.</p>
<p>Understand all you fallen ones that the totality of your kingdom will be utterly decimated in front of you all at the hands of my might warriors, even my own children who are my mighty 144,000 of which order Biblaridion:144 stands as an example of obedience, as he walks fully in great might and strength that I, Yeshua HaMashiach have infused into his spirit eternally and forevermore. Truly it is, where my mighty messenger is held as an example, it is done so all you 144,000 would understand the power and might that you are the children of Yeshua HaMashiach, therefore you 144,000: I am your Father Yeshua, and I am no respecter of persons. One of you will chase so many more than 1000. Selah.</p>
<p>RISE UP NOW AT MY COMMAND ALL YOU 144,000 AND SHAKE OFF YOUR COMPLACENCY AT THE SOUND OF MY COMMAND!</p>
<p>DEPART BABYLON's WAYS IMMEDIATELY!</p>
<p>THE HOUR OF HER JUDGMENT IS NOW!</p>
<p>YOUR FULL REDEMPTION IS NOW!</p>
<p>Hear my Words, all you children of your Father Yeshua, even all you 144,000 and understand this Little Book that I have opened in the hands of my mighty messenger and servant is for you all to wield mightily in my power and might!</p>
<p>I Father Yeshua command all my 144,000: Take your war scroll in hand and declare in great power my Words at my command and lead!</p>
<p>That you would understand your true selves because there is no other source on earth where you are revealed, except in Revelation 7, 10, and 14. And then only revealed in great mystery and stealth because you all have been hidden from the fallen ones on the earth for my purposes, so that you are now forged and folded and readied for departure that is here in this season of NOW.</p>
<p>Woe, woe, great woe to all you fallen ones because you came to the garden of El Shaddai thinking you would live out your pleasures and lusts in great hate on Elohim's creation. You have dominated the weak and frail and innocent in great prideful hate, even foolishly trying to boast over Elohim that his masterpiece was nothing more than weak and frail and could be easily overcome and dominated by your unholy wiles against Adam and Eve. And in your arrogance, you have dominated and abused Adonai-YHVH's creation for your own hateful lusts. Therefore, understand that my children, yes, my own children who are that mighty and invincible 144,000 will decimate and abuse you all according to my exact instructions that will be exactly according to your own worthless actions and ways have been and that are recorded in perfect painstaking detail.</p>
<p>At the times of the gathering of the saints, the restrainer will be removed, and judgment will fall fully on the house of God. And those who have allowed me to refine them in the refiner's fire will stand because they have been purified in the blood of the lamb and will stand in the righteousness that I have given them, because I am the Righteous Lord who is a life-giving spirit.</p>
<p>And so, the greatest tribulation will occur, even a tribulation that the likes have never been experienced on earth before, and truly, never will be again. Behold! I, even Yeshuah HaMashiach, will not leave my people to sudden destruction, and I will yet save Israel, even that mighty remnant who will accept me as the true Messiah, for so Yahweh has created me to be. And so will my 144,000 come to the aid of those who would otherwise perish and who call on my name. I will lead them step by step, and my 144,000 will do many mighty works for me.</p>
<p>For these are those who are taken in the gathering of the saints to me, Christ Jesus, in the air at the sound of the last trumpet, and the trumpet is about to sound. These are my faithful, even those in whom was found no guile, for they have purified themselves as a chaste virgin in the blood of the Lamb, which I offered forevermore as their high priest, for I am forevermore the high priest after the order of Melchizedek. These are my Bride, and they will follow me wherever I go. Behold! I will make them powerful, and nothing has ever been seen on earth that can compare to the abilities with which I will clothe them. They will be clothed in fine, white, spotless linen, and their abilities will embody their accomplishments, and great abilities will they possess; for they are faithful, called, and chosen, even from before the foundations of the world by Yahweh for these purposes.</p>
<p>My 144,000 will descend on Mount Sion, and I will lead them. They will take those to whom I lead them into the wilderness to be hidden away from the utter darkness and persecution of the enemies' kingdom. They will be led to safety from the seven plagues, for in these judgments is the severity of the wrath of God to be poured out on the seat of the beast and to torment the kingdom of the Dragon, for great is their punishment. And the 144,000 will lead them to safety; they will heal them from their wounds; they will succor them and give them great hope to call on the name of the Lord, even to the end if need be. For had I not shortened the days, no flesh would be left alive. And so, they will complete that in which I will lead them.</p>
<p>I will now speak of things to come during Daniel's seventieth week and will make your paths plain, and I will extend my saving grace at the hands of my 144,000. For they do come to save my people from destruction, and they do come to hide away my people from wrath, even the wrath of God that is intended for the fallen ones and those who attach themselves forevermore to them and their kingdom by taking their mark, even that beastly serpent's bite of which there is no remedy.</p>
<p>And yet so it is that I will snatch my Bride into the heavens, and I will seal my 144,000 from the following tribes, even 12,000 from each of the following: Judah, Reuben, Gad, Asher, Nephthali, Manasses, Simeon, Levi, Issachar, Zabulon, Joseph, and Benjamin. So, hear my voice!</p>
<p>And they will be an unstoppable force; even an unbreakable force will they be. For theirs are lives eternal, of which no corruption can corrupt. Theirs are bodies indestructible, for no destruction can take hold of the redeemed; for victory over death and destruction do they evermore have for all eternity. They will be re-created as children of light, and with everlasting glory will they be clothed, and they will have unique abilities and talents written into their very being that will reflect their accomplishments which comprise and embody abilities that I will create within them. For I, Christ Jesus, am the refiner who sits with billow in hand, stoking the flames of purification, that I may re-create you all newly in me, Christ Jesus your ascended Lord and Savior; and to whosoever overcomes, even they will inherit all things.</p>
<p>Understand my children that all the faithful in Christ Jesus that are his church, his body, and even his bride are chosen specifically in Christ Jesus before the foundations of the world. While many interpret these Words with silly phrases like "highly favored and truly blessed" to give comfort to the flesh when stated faithlessly and without understanding my eternal truths, that is not the full intent but certainly true for the faithful in Christ on account of their obedience and repentance.</p>
<p>Understand, the phrase "chosen in him before the foundations of the world" indicates that your Adonai-YHVH has personally selected and guided in full strength of will and perfectly purposeful design, without ever violating any person's free will in the least, by selectively forming, making, and recreating in Christ Jesus each of you with full understanding and full artistic license and design with such incredible attention to detail into each and every one of you that has taken the entirety of the ages from Adam and Eve until now to accomplish in my precision.</p>
<p>You are my masterpieces created in Christ!</p>
<p>Which artistry, precision and design are seeded in your genetic coding where I have literally selected by great skill and craft every detail of you all for my eternal purposes that are to be revealed fully in my throne room, instantly and forcefully at my command. Therefore, understand I have formed, made, and created each of you so specifically and in such minute detail that you simply cannot fathom what you are all about to be changed according to my very unique and chosen purposes for each and every one of you.</p>
<p>Therefore, fear not, your Adonai-YHVH does not selectively make one being different over another so a perceived advantage could be celebrated in boastful sin, nor so one creation would then dominate another in sinful and hateful foolish violence, but so that my eternal purposes would be fulfilled in you all. Of an eternal truth: It has not fully entered into the heart of man at the time of this writing what you will be recreated and to what purposes. Wherefore, I ask you in my love for you (my created and selected on account of your faith, my faithfully repenting children) to have just the faith as a grain of mustard seed and understand that from the least to the greatest amongst the Israel of Adonai-YHVH you are all perfectly and wonderfully made and designed and forged so mightily and powerfully that it is the Israel of Adonai-YHVH that will be admired by all.</p>
<p>Peace be to you fully.</p>
<p>And this with no respecter of persons, but instead by my righteous and eternal omnipotent knowledge and precise control of all things where I chose each of you in such manner for my eternal purposes in Christ Jesus. Because I fully knew in eternities past each of you, individually, would come fully to Christ Jesus in your times, so I provided. Therefore, understand while hidden mysteries are revealed by testimony and example of service in Biblaridion:144, these things are done so you may all begin to understand the magnitude of your inheritance and eternal purposes in which I have created, selected, and made you all by intelligent design to the minutest detail. Rejoice!</p>
<p>Therefore, come fully to Yeshua HaMashiach even all you faithful in Christ Jesus, so you may receive your full double reward in full honor, that he has in hand that I have given for all who overcome in like manner as Christ Jesus overcame. Hear my Words of encouragement even all you 144,000, who are the adopted children of your Father Yeshua, and he will share all things with you his children, who are also his faithful overcomers, who have overcome all things as Yeshua HaMashiach overcame. However, these are not the only overcomers who will have overcome all things against them, because many, many amongst the faithful in Christ Jesus who are not 144,000 have overcome all things in like manner as Christ Jesus, and great is their reward!</p>
<p>Because you are to be born into my throne room, where I excitedly wait like the expectant Father that I AM, for the full delivery of the Israel of Adonai-YHVH that is to be gathered NOW.</p>
<p>With this perspective in mind, I do come to help each of you understand the effort and detail employed in great wisdom and skill by your Adonai-YHVH to conceal and protect you from Heylel Ben Shachar who would kill from the earth any of my children given the opportunity, but yet reveal you enough so you would then be forged according to my eternal purposes in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>Therefore, you were marked and protected, yet concealed and hidden in plain sight, yet revealed just enough: And all by the hands of Christ Jesus! Because he it is who loved you and gave himself, and sanctified, and purified and justified his mighty Church that is composed of the faithful in Christ Jesus. Because truly, the gates of Hell will never prevail against the true Church in all its mighty glory and power. Even which Church is to be transformed and changed now for their true and concealed to now be fully revealed purposes that you all will know fully even as you are known.</p>
<p>Be patient my children, your times are NOW.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I have separated one distinct group from the Church, designating them beforehand for my purposes (even though you all have a designation) and given them to Christ Jesus. Therefore, understand this distinction for all you 144,000 and even all who read these Words.</p>
<p>Christ Jesus in his love for you all, and his love and obedience to his Adonai-YHVH did raise up children for Adonai-YHVH who are the faithful in Christ Jesus and sealed with that holy spirt of promise and set apart and dedicated eternally to fill the vacated orders in the Heavens in double honor, and also inherit the earth in double honor because you chose to have faith in the testimony of Jesus the Nazarene in this evil day, even that lamb of God when he was revealed to you by your Adonai-YHVH and when given the chance to have just the faith of a grain of mustard seed, you believed! And that mighty and eternal seed has grown so mightily now in you all! Yet only revealed fully in my throne room so suddenly and unexpectedly now.</p>
<p>STAY READIED!</p>
<p>Understand fully, that the faithful in Christ Jesus are children of Adonai-YHVH, who will serve Christ Jesus, who is also Yeshua HaMashiach, in your assignments and in your assigned orders that I have prepared perfectly and tailored to each and every one of you. Your reward is tailored to you so perfectly and will be greater one over another, only according as your faithfulness has been. Nevertheless, this is not a hindrance to your glorification by inheritance, but honor given to whom honor is deserved for the many things accomplished in service to Christ Jesus by you all. And you all are so unique one from another, yet similar in the things you have endured and overcame by the mighty hand of Christ Jesus who has helped you all.</p>
<p>Also, taken from amongst the faithful in Christ Jesus are the 144,000 who are specifically set apart as the adopted children of Yeshua HaMashiach, selected from amongst the Israel of Adonai-YHVH specifically by my chosen hand, and eternal and unhindered will. These fiery warriors were then forged in great affliction and through many trials and tribulations have they all endured at the hands of Heylel Ben Shachar, and are now folded and forged in great might and strength so that they are fully forged in their hearts that will never betray the purposes of Adonai-YHVH expressed in Yeshua HaMashiach, even preserved in unbending and all powerfully Agape love. Selah.</p>
<p>Therefore, understand my 144,000, that you all are mightily and perfectly created in full powerful and intelligent design, and at command of Christ Jesus, who is also Yeshua HaMashiach, you would accomplish our eternal purposes against this infernal snake, and so that all of the fallen ones may be fully judged with full recompense and penalty given in full and righteous fiery judgment on this failed and foolish little prince. Even so, all of you 144,000 are the agents of these actions that are given with full view to scripture that is exactly written: Vengeance is mine: I will repay, says the Lord. Therefore, you are the designated agents of this righteous repayment of recompense on all the fallen one's heads, but especially that foolish, and failed and ever boastful little prince, Heylel Ben Shachar.</p>
<p>And so it is, the 144,000 are Jesus Christ's mighty warrior Bride who are empowered under the mighty mantle of the High Priest Forevermore after the Order of Melchizedek, even an order with 12,000 sealed in their foreheads from each tribe of the Israel of Adonai-Yahweh. Even a brotherhood of mighty warriors forged in the fires of affliction who will be invincible to all things by my power and my hand, and my might given in the face of Christ Jesus, into whose hands all things are given for fulfillment.</p>
<p>For so it is, Yeshua HaMashiach's mighty 144,000 have all been forged in the fires of affliction, where each stroke intended for their destruction given by Heylel Ben Shachar is instead used to fold these mighty warriors into unbreakable vessels of war, even Holy and righteous weapons of war and judgment for so they are! And they will bring great judgment, and recompense, and war, and destruction on all of Heylel Ben Shachar's Kingdom and even fiery judgment onto the fallen ones own heads and into their own bosoms eternally and forevermore!</p>
<p>Therefore, understand who you are, even all you warriors whom I have formed, made, and created for these end times. Even all those whom Christ Jesus has raised from their youth, even forged alive in the refiners fire for my eternal purposes.</p>
<p>Hear my call my 144,000!</p>
<p>For I have created you for my purposes, and you are the children of Yeshua HaMashiach that he has raised himself as his own. And yet you are all children of the Most High God, even Adonai-Yahweh, the Great I AM, and I have begotten you all in Christ Jesus by my eternal spirit and there is nothing that has ever been created like you in my creation for I have empowered you all, and will lift you all into the heavens so suddenly and unexpectedly now.</p>
<p>You all are Christ Jesus overcomers, who has overcome all things giving you an eternal example and he has caused you to follow in victory! And it is Yeshua HaMashiach who has separated you all for his purposes, and who is absolutely forging you all still to this very second in the refiners fire, because he is the smith who stokes the coals in righteous perfection.</p>
<p>Yet, so many of you do not understand your calling and this because your lives are hidden in Christ Jesus, who is also Yeshua HaMashiach and when he shall appear, so to shall you appear with him recreated in eternal power and splendor, and you all will come to be admired in this fast approaching day that is about to explode across the earth, even as you are Harpazoed into the heavens and rescued and redeemed from destruction and judgment that is not for you, in the twinkling of an eye, Selah!</p>
<p>Hear the voice of Adonai Yahweh, even all you 144,000 and understand the truth that I will now reveal regarding the mighty warrior Bride of the Lion of the Tribe of Judah! Understand all you 144,000 that Yeshua HaMashiach who is also the Lion of the Tribe of Judah has forged you for his purposes and it is he who leads you all directly, even separated from the Church where you have been hidden and preserved by Christ Jesus mighty hands.</p>
<p>And it is The Lion of the Tribe of Judah who is always forging you all in great strength, and truly, he has forged you all your entire lives in his fires of purification. So many of you have left homes, and lands, and families and given so much and even given your lives with intent and sacrifice to your Lord. And he has formed you, and he has forged you, and many of you he has recreated and healed from great damage and great destruction inflicted upon you in great hate, by those evil ones that you have fully overcome, should you remain faithful in patience.</p>
<p>Yet for every affliction there is newly formed strength and eternal recompense!</p>
<p>Yet for every loss there is newly formed strength and eternal recompense!</p>
<p>Yet, for every sacrifice there is newly formed strength and eternal recompense!</p>
<p>Understand who you are, even all of you 144,000, for you will all be taken in the great gathering of the faithful in Christ to meet your Lord in the air at the sound of that sudden and unexpected trumpet blast that is to sound, where the dead in Christ will rise first and you who are alive and remain will join them in the twinkling of an eye where you all will be birthed alive and changed and recreated eternally and forevermore. Even changed alive into eternal and incorruptible warriors and guardians who now serve the Lion of the Tribe of Judah and are under his direct command, and you are all under the mantle of that mighty and eternal Order of Melchizedek, and you all serve and will enter eternal covenant with The Everlasting Lord of Righteousness, even Yeshua HaMashiach, who is also The Lion of The Tribe of Judah, who has created his own unique warrior lions in each of you!</p>
<p>So know, and understand that all things of the fallen ones will be cleansed from the earth fully and the earth will be remade during Jacobs trouble, which is also Daniels seventieth week, because I will burn all things of the fallen ones to ashes on the face of the earth, that truly you all may inherit beauty on the newly made earth instead of ashes, of which all things evil will be reduced and cleansed from my creation. Yet, you are the agents that will cause ashes on the earth by Christ Jesus mighty power, that flows from ME, through him, (directly into each of the faithful in Christ Jesus) but especially for my set apart purposes into all of you 144,000 at Christ Jesus command. And you will utterly cleanse the earth at Yeshua HaMashiach's command who will lead you step by step in my plans of full redemption that are now coming to full consummation in Christ Jesus. Selah.</p>
<p>Understand who and what you are children of Yeshua HaMashiach, because he has raised you for my eternal purposes given at his command and all of Christ Jesus 144,000 will enter covenantal perfection with he who loved them and gave himself for them fully, so that truly, he would present you all without spot and blemish so suddenly and unexpectedly now in my very own throne room, because a child is to be born!</p>
<p>My 144,000 will shelter my people and take them to places of safety to weather the storm as the land is cleansed from all unrighteousness, even the evil tares. For had I not shortened the days no flesh would survive, and so I will shelter many in the wilderness. This will happen in part so that a remnant of mankind is saved. The 144,000 come to earth clothed in garments that I will specifically tailor for them, and they are unbreakable and will be mighty and powerful and no element of the enemy will gain ascendancy, and so the purposes of Yahweh will be fulfilled.</p>
<p>As war breaks across the land and the horseman execute their judgments on the earth, great misery and desolation will come on the world. The world that now is will never again be; when the restrainer is removed, everything will be different.</p>
<p>There will be great death, pestilence, great famine, and great injustice; and yet my 144,000 will be protected from wrath and judgment, for they will carry the seal of the Living God, even Yahweh, in their foreheads; for so will they be sealed, and I send my angels to seal them. And so great chaos and lawlessness will rule the day. The first 42 months will be times of great persecution and great trouble, but the great tribulation will happen in the second 42 months: for there are 84 months in the seven days of years of Jacob's trouble. And so, the second half is the great tribulation, but the tribulation and persecution on the land will be horrible for the inhabitants of the earth the entire time.</p>
<p>My 144,000 are not sent to their cities, where all have to take the mark to live. But they will be sent to and fro and will gather many to them and care for many and will help bring great multitudes in salvation to me, Yeshua HaMashiach (in whatever language): all who will call on my name until the end shall be saved. God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. As in the days of Noah, those who are godly will live outside of their evil fallen-angel society, for theirs will be a society of sin that leads to eternal damnation in the unquenchable fires; so, join them not because the choice is permanent. And so, my 144,000 will bring salvation and help to many.</p>
<p>They will do mighty signs, miracles, and wonders, and I will lead them step by step, and I will direct their paths to those to whom I am sending them. And I will gather my sheep to them so they may be led to safety. And whosoever loves not their lives to the end will be saved. And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever.</p>
<p>I am he who will direct and lead my 144,000, and they will sing a new song that no man can learn.</p>
<p>I, even Yeshuah HaMashiach, will not leave Jacob to sudden destruction, and I will yet save Israel, even that mighty remnant who will accept me as their true Messiah, for so Yahweh has created me to be. And so will my 144,000 come to the aid of those who would otherwise perish and who call on my name. I will lead them step by step, and my 144,000 will do many mighty works for me, even greater works than I did during my time in sinless flesh as the lamb of God.</p>
<p>My 144,000 will descend on Mount Sion, and I will lead them. They will take those to whom I lead them into the wilderness to be hidden away from the utter darkness and persecution of the enemies' kingdom. They will be led to safety from the full indignation of the wrath of God contained in seven vials; for in these vials is the severity of the wrath of God to be poured out on the seat of the beast and to torment the kingdom of the Dragon, for great is their punishment. And the 144,000 will lead Jacob to safety; they will heal them from their wounds; they will succor them and give them great hope to call on the name of the Lord, even to the end if need be. For had I not shortened the days, no flesh should be saved. And so, they will complete that in which I will lead them. And Jacob will be hidden safely away from the day of that great battle, even that great battle of Armageddon of which their utter destruction they shall not escape.</p>
<p>But when has Yahweh ever left heirs of salvation to eternal destruction, and I declare it openly before it occurs: That I, Yeshua HaMashiach, will yet save a remnant of Jacob, and many from the land will accept me as their Messiah. And I will rescue them. Behold, it is written: And I looked, and lo, a Lamb stood on mount Sion, and with him 144,000 having his Father's Name written in their foreheads. And so it will be that I will come to rescue a remnant from destruction, and I do come with Judah, Reuben, Gad, Asher, Nephthali, Manasses, Simeon, Levi, Issachar, Zabulon, Joseph, and Benjamin. So, hear my voice! an unstoppable force who will walk step by step as I lead them to lead my little ones to safety. Perhaps you may wonder who the 144,000 are and to what purpose they follow me to Mount Sion?</p>
<p>The 144,000 are chosen by Yahweh before the foundations of the earth for such a time. They are forged in affliction, and they will possess unique abilities and strengths that I will clothe them with in their new garments that I will give, for their garments are tailored specifically for them and will contain their accomplishments and attributes. They will be taken in the gathering of the faithful but are set apart for my purposes, even the purposes of Yahweh and Yeshua HaMashiach. They come during the great tribulation to lead Israel to safety but first are taken to marry Christ, for I am the Bridegroom, and they are my Bride, the called, chosen, faithful, and true, even those whom I have made pure as a virgin in my atoning blood. And it is you, my Bride, who shall serve Yahweh's purposes at my command in the times of the greatest troubles.</p>
<p>Behold, it is written! And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand, two hundred, and threescore days. And so it will be that I will provide a place of refuge in the wilderness for my people, for I will yet save Jacob from their troubles, and many from the land of promise will turn to me, Yeshua HaMashiach, who is their true Messiah. And I will save them from the trap that will be set for them, and so I warn all before it happens to stay away from the trap and do not follow them. Do not believe their lying signs and wonders, neither believe their blasphemous words, but call on the name of the Lord, even Yeshuah HaMashiach, who is Jesus Christ in the English tongue, because in whatever language a person calls on my name, even they will be saved when they call on my name to the end.</p>
<p>Yet, I will come to save a mighty remnant from Jacob at the hands of my mighty 144,000! Selah!</p>
<p>I am, Christ Jesus, and I have previously declared the gathering of the faithful in Christ to their Everlasting and Eternal Lord, even in The Gospel of Salvation and The Mystery of God and The Everlasting Gospel and I do come to establish the surety of my declarations and also the declarations of Yahweh, for whatever declarations are made in the throne and power of Yahweh will come to pass exactly as declared and there will be no more delay.</p>
<p>I am your Everlasting Lord of Righteousness, and I do come to reprove as many as I love, because it is not proper that anyone of the faithful in Christ, even my very Bride who have overcome all things even as I overcame should sit downcast as if your hope of redemption in the full new birth in the heaven of heavens has been put on hold or delayed or that perhaps your Lord tarried by the wayside in unfaithfulness. God forbid an impossibility that will never occur!</p>
<p>For such things are an impossibility, although Satan would seek to tear your faith down with his fiery darts, therefore, quench his darts with the shield of faith, (and even all of my enablements I have given you) and stand in earnest and excited expectation for my appearing. Fret not over the date setters and the many voices who peep and mutter but look to your Lord of Lords and King of Kings who is approaching and who will do exactly as has been declared in the throne of Yahweh.</p>
<p>And so I ask, who is there who can stop my mighty hand from snatching away those I love and have sealed with the holy spirit of promise so that you may bring symmetry to the heavens and bring righteousness to the earth when you come to rule with your King of Kings and Lord of Lords, even a mighty rule under The High Priest forever after the Order of Melchizedek? Selah!</p>
<p>Behold, I am NOW on earth with you. Therefore, watch in all earnest expectation because the faithful in Christ will not be left to the refiners fire in great disappointment. Truly, you have overcome in these times of NOW. Selah.</p>
<p>These will be the darkest times my children, for I Yeshua HaMashiach do tell you these things before they happen, and they are written as a warning to all. And so will my 144,000 come to the aid of those who would otherwise perish and who call on my name. I will lead them step by step, and they will do many mighty works for me. For these are those who are taken in the gathering of the saints to me, Christ Jesus, in the air at the sound of the last trumpet and the trumpet is about to sound.</p>
<p>These are my faithful, even those in whom was found no guile, for they have purified themselves as a chaste virgin in the blood of the Lamb which I offered forevermore as their high priest, for I am forevermore the high priest after the order of Melchizedek. These are my bride, and they will follow me wherever I go. Behold! I will make them powerful, and nothing has ever been seen on earth that can compare to the abilities with which I will clothe them. They will be clothed in fine, white, spotless linen and their abilities will embody their accomplishments, and great abilities will they possess for they are faithful called and chosen even from before the foundations of the world by Yahweh for these purposes.</p>
<p>My 144,000 will descend on Mount Sion, and I will lead them. They will take those I lead them into the wilderness to be hidden away from the utter darkness and persecution of the enemies' kingdom. They will be led to safety from the seven plagues for in these judgments is the severity of the wrath of God to be poured out on the seat of the beast and to torment the kingdom of the dragon for great is their punishment. And the 144,000 will lead them to safety, they will heal them from their wounds, they will succor them and give them great hope to call on the name of the Lord even to the end if need be. For had I not shortened the days, no flesh would be left alive. And so, they will complete that in which I will lead them.</p>
<p>Behold!</p>
<div class="indent">
<p>I am he that will rule the earth from David's throne and will smite the nations with a rod of iron.</p>
<p>I am he who is worthy to take the book and break the seals.</p>
<p>I am he who commands the angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God, for they will seal my 144,000, even the servants of the living God.</p>
<p>I am he who will stand on Mount Zion with my 144,000, and they will sing a new song that no man can learn.</p>
<p>I am Lord of Lords and King of Kings, and I do come to make war on the kings of the earth, for their time has come.</p>
<p>I am he who is coming for my Bride, for my appearing is at hand. Ready yourselves, my Bride!</p>
</div>
<p>For you are the first fruits gathered from the fields of harvest, for I am the Lord of harvest, and now it is time to gather you into my barn that you may receive the reward of your labors. For those who have gathered wheat will have plenty, and those who have gathered straw shall suffer loss as the chaff burns in the fire, but yet they shall be saved. And so, my laborers and people shall come to their inheritance in me, Yeshua HaMashiach, for I am Lord of Lords and King of Kings and I will not be silenced, nor will I be stopped.</p>
<p>Also, during this time it is given to the dragon, the beast from the sea, and the false prophet to make war on the saints and to overcome them. Yet, those who love their lives not to the end and all who call on the name of Jesus until their end will achieve eternal salvation and a mighty eternal inheritance of whose weight is not worthy to be compared to their sufferings they will endure for my namesake. And I, Yeshua HaMashiach, will lead my mighty 144,000 for the rescue of Jacob, even that mighty remnant who will accept me as their Messiah, even all from Israel who are of the actual bloodlines of promise and will be separated and taken alive into the wilderness to a place prepared for them of Yahweh where they will remain hidden safely away from the greatest tribulation to ever overtake the earth, and truly times of trouble will never overtake the earth again, for so has Yahweh, The Great I AM, declared!</p>
<p>Understand further, the 144,000 are chosen by Yahweh before the foundations of the earth for such a time. They are forged in affliction, and all possess unique abilities and strengths. They will be taken in the rapture of the faithful but are set apart for Yeshua HaMashiach's purposes and will be accordingly sealed in their foreheads in the heavens. They come later to the earth during the great tribulation to lead Israel to safety. But first they are taken to marry their Bridegroom for they are my Bride, the called, chosen, faithful, and true. Even those whom I, Christ Jesus, have made pure as a virgin in my atoning blood. Therefore, anyone who speaks contrary to these Words does not know me, neither speaks for me! Selah!</p>
<p>Ready yourselves, my bride and buy oil of me that your lamps may be filled! My oil is found in my Words my love, even in the very Words you now read, and I have given you multitudes of Words to comfort, keep, and guide you into all righteousness where that wicked one touches you not!</p>
<p>Ready yourselves, my loves, because it is always time to trim your wicks, and you will trim your wicks by repentance of sins and producing fruit of the spirit as you overcome the works of the flesh by way of my holy spirit that is born within you fully, and can never be removed once it has rooted itself into the hearts of men in all holiness and righteousness. Keep your hearts always soft to my love and instructions, even so that you are kept fully safe and protected from all evil in the palm of my eternal hands.</p>
<p>Ready yourselves, O' Faithful in Christ, and understand the nearness of the final hour when the gathering of the faithful in Christ occurs, snatching you all away into the full safety and reward of the heavens that is now set to engulf the earth in my glorious appearing. As my glory shines like lightning out of the east into the west, many of you will see the brightness of my coming.</p>
<p>Then, truly, truly, when the mighty shout of the Archangel breaks across the world, as that mighty trumpet blast is heralded across the earth, the dead in Christ will be birthed out of the earth with great and mighty force and power; then you which are alive and remain will be caught up with them to meet your Everlasting Lord of Righteousness in the air, and you will instantly find yourselves clothed in full glory and a very bright and glorious nature, standing in the heaven of heavens. You will see fully, you will hear fully, you will know even as you are known, and many of you will be reunited with your loved ones, and all will rejoice!</p>
<p>You who are alive and remain will understand the event you suddenly find yourselves engulfed, and you will hear the Words "Come up Hither!" and you will feel yourselves pulled mightily and swiftly upwards into the brightness of my glory and the birth pangs will cease as the eternal children of Yahweh are birthed into the heavens where they will stand in great glory and eternal reward according as their faithfulness has been.</p>
<p>Ready yourselves, my Bride, and come fully to me in full repentance and depart from all evil so that your lamps are full and your wicks are trimmed and that you may be readied for your Bridegroom who surely approaches, and the hour of my journey nears completion! Selah!</p>
<p>My 144,000 will descend on Mount Sion and I will lead them. They will take those I lead them into the wilderness to be hidden away from the utter darkness and persecution of the enemies' kingdom. They will be led to safety from the seven plagues for in these judgments is the severity of the wrath of God to be poured out on the seat of the beast and to torment the kingdom of the dragon for great is their punishment. And the 144,000 will lead them to safety, they will heal them from their wounds, they will succor them and give them great hope to call on the name of the Lord even to the end if need be. For had I not shortened the days, no flesh would be left alive. And so, they will complete that in which I will lead them.</p>
<p>And of Israel, my brethren, I will yet come to save you and I will come to your aid with my 144,000 even those who have purified themselves fully as my overcomers in my atoning and redeeming blood in their day of salvation and they will be gathered to me at that great gathering that is about to happen suddenly on the earth. For I will lead my 144,000 to descend onto Mount Zion, and they will follow me step by step as they lead my remnant of Jacob to safety in the wilderness where a place is prepared by Yahweh for their safety, and they will be fed and cared for and the dragon, the beast, and false prophet will touch them not, neither find them, of which remnant you are O' Israel.</p>
<p>But Barabbas will bring the abomination of desolation and many tares will be cleansed from the land, and I will hide my remnant away from the battle of that great day, even the day of my second coming of which day Yahweh has marked in eternities past and is set eternally in his timetable of salvation and that day surely approaches, for so it is written and so shall it be done.</p>
<p>Therefore, understand there are several harvests for Adam. The first-fruits barley harvest is for my faithful in Christ, even all those who walked faithfully by my spirit in my times of grace and mercy even those who have cultivated fruit of the spirit in their lives by obedience to my Words as they walked in my spirit of sonship whereby they are sealed to the great day of redemption. These are the faithful in Christ and also my overcomers and my bride and my 144,000 that I will send to save alive Jacob from the hand of Ashkenaz and Esau.</p>
<p>So understand Israel, that you will have to live separate from their society and they will seek, and hunt all who refuse their abominable society and all who refuse their beastly mark and all who turn to Yeshua HaMashiach or who call on the name of the Lord Jesus to the end. Even all of these will be fugitives in the earth, and I will hide away in the wilderness by the hands of my 144,000 all those of Jacob, which is Israel, who will have accepted me as their true Messiah.</p>
<p>And my 144,000 will be changed and sealed and fully recreated for the purposes that they have been called and prepared to accomplish. Truly, truly, every soul who has believed on my mighty name and made me their everlasting Lord will be changed fully and recreated newly as a new creation, and they will be fashioned as I am. And never again will they sin, either through pride nor ungodliness and never again will they be cursed, and never again will sickness or pain, or death or sorrow ever touch them again for the former things are passed away and the true light now shines.</p>
<p>And it is I, Christ Jesus, who will now move to reveal himself to Jacob and whosoever calls on my mighty name to the end shall be saved, even all the dwellers on the earth who are ordained to eternal life and there will be a great multitude who will accept me as their Messiah and I will have saved them to the uttermost.</p>
<p>I am coming for you, my loves, and the times are now. I have waited an entire age of grace and have saved many, and many will be risen to newness of life in me, Christ Jesus their eternal Lord, and the dead in Christ will rise first, and the last trumpet is at the ready now. Many signs miracles and wonders have covered the earth in their splendor and the signs are non-stop around the world now that announce my appearing, that announce the marriage of the Lamb to his faithful bride, and the banquet halls in the heavens are prepared and at the ready.</p>
<p>And so it is, a heavenly celebration awaits my faithful, called, and chosen, and now is time for them to cease forever from their labors that they have labored in the earth in their houses of clay, and they have labored in the flesh as my fellow workers and have gathered and brought many to me, the Lord Jesus Christ that they may receive everlasting salvation forevermore. For though their flesh was corrupted in sin by Satan, I have given them a purpose and called them to leave forever the futility of which they were condemned by sin.</p>
<p>And so they have this treasure in earthen vessels that the power of God does live and dwell in them, and they did many mighty works in my name, and I am he who empowered them to become heirs of salvation and heirs of eternal life and I have redeemed them and given that eternal down payment in the new birth and I have sealed them all with that holy spirit of promise, even that unbreakable seal of promise.</p>
<p>And now it is time to fully redeem the purchased possession, even all who have made me Lord from a faith filled heart knowing that Yahweh raised me from the dead to die no more. Now are the times of their full redemption where they will receive fully of their down payment received of me in the new birth of Christ in you the hope of glory!</p>
<p>Behold! Hear my voice and understand my words and know that your glorious future is not years away, nor is it set to arrive in Jubilees to come, but is NOW my loves and suddenly in an eternal instant will you all be changed and the times of your changing are NOW. You will find yourselves suddenly transformed into eternal glory, and I will clothe you in spotless garments that can never be soiled. Suddenly will you find yourselves standing in Yahweh's throne room, even in the Father of Light's eternal splendorudah.</p>
<p>For as I snatch my Bride into the heavens, great calamity will engulf Secret Babylon, and she shall be destroyed in one hour, and in one hour shall she be destroyed, and nothing can change her fate, for Yahweh has so declared. And so that finality will fully arrive when I gather the faithful of my Church to me in the clouds and when their departing shakes the entire world. It will literally shake the earth, and great shaking will consume Secret Babylon, and she will be rent up the middle as my saints depart.</p>
<p>She will be utterly burned with fire from the sky and their missiles will fall. Her skirts will be covered with waters from the east and from the west! For a mighty angel will take up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all. For thus is it written, and thus shall it be done!</p>
<p>For great is her judgment, and judgment has begun at the house of God.</p>
<p>Hear my Words, my Body, My Church, and even my Bride! Hear my voice and stop yourselves at the sounds of my Words and hear their resonant authority echo into this world, for the earth is the Lords and the fullness thereof!</p>
<p>Hear my Words my mighty 144,000 and understand my speech and ready yourselves for the appearing of your Lord, King, High Priest, and Messiah! For you will be taken into the heavens at that approaching trumpet blast, even that same mighty trumpet given into my might hands to sound so suddenly and unexpectedly now, Selah! Therefore, ready yourselves my wise virgins, because I am coming for you, and who is it who can stop me, I SAY WHO!</p>
<p>Behold! A trumpet I hold in hand, given to sound at my command and at my signal a mighty shout!</p>
<p>And the world will go dark as the light of my appearing shines over the earth, for I will not share my glory with another!</p>
<p>Behold, I come! Behold, I come! Behold! I Come! Hear my declarations and hear my speech and tremble O' Secret Babylon.</p>
<p>For as my light shatters the thick darkness, for darkness cannot overcome my light nor the lights of the world, who are empowered by Christ Jesus and sent in great authority by the Father of Lights and your times of full redemption have come.</p>
<p>Therefore, look to me, Christ Jesus and keep your eyes up and open focused on your Lord Jesus Christ in all readiness and obedience. Arrange your affairs, for it will now be that suddenly on the earth, you are not.</p>
<p>And so I command you my loves, fill your lamps, and trim your wicks and take my fire and light your lamps ablaze to illumine yourselves in my Words, and understand that you are to wait by the wayside, for the Bridegroom does approach for both his Bride, and our guests. Selah.</p>
<p>Selah! My Loves, Selah, my Doves, for I do love you, and I am coming and the hour is upon you.</p>
<p>Truly, truly I am he, who has sewn and crafted the utterances of The Seven Thunders into my Little Book's spirit because he is my Biblaridion:144 into whom these seven thunders that govern that Little Book that I have opened in his hand, which is also that Everlasting Gospel, with which I have called and readied my 144,000, even by these Words that are tuned by my mighty hand to find the eyes, ears, and hearts of all those to whom they are sent, so hear my voice given in the Words of my messenger and servant that I had hidden in my quiver for such a time as this!</p>
<p>So further understand just what this means my loves, because there is no more delay, and I, Christ Jesus, do declare in the person of my mighty messenger and servant, that time shall be no more!</p>
<p>Because my invitation has been heralded across the earth for an entire age of grace now, and many have responded, and many will accordingly be fully redeemed so suddenly and unexpectedly now. And my overcomers will fill fully the vacated orders left open in the heavens by Heylel Ben Shachar and so I will reveal these seven heads who are the seven satans, led by Heylel Ben Shachar.</p>
<p>Although, in their judgment they are stripped of all personhood and are simply known as the satans, and these evil seraphim will be bound, and cast to the hottest flames of blue and their punishment is the most severe of all the condemned, who will be given to the flames of punishment, eternally bound for full recompense and fiery judgment for all eternity that they shall never escape, not have a moment's rest.</p>
<p>Prepare yourselves, my mighty warrior bride, yea, prepare yourselves because you are my 144,000! Understand just who you are, because you are my warrior bride, and there is nothing that has been created that will compare to you my faithful Bride, with whom I will share all things in my eternal inheritance. For one of you will truly chase a thousand and there is nothing and no being who can stand against you, nor hinder you, nor hurt you, nor stop you in the least because truly, truly you will be fully invincible, so much so that you will all be sealed mightily in your foreheads that even that full wrath of Elohim will not touch you not!</p>
<p>Understand that you will rescue alive my mighty remnant from Jacob after the flesh that you will save alive in the wilderness in places prepared beforehand ready to receive and nurture those whom I will save alive as their Kinsman Redeemer! And no force, nor ploy, nor effort, nor any such thing that the enemy would seek to hinder will matter in the least, but all of their efforts will collapse fully on their own heads as the full wrath of Elohim is poured out in full finality of judgment during the wrath of Elohim contained in those seven vials that are soon to be fully released in hand by my seven mighty angels, and they shall not escape!</p>
<p>And there, in the wilderness even hidden away, will Jacob be cared for, and fed, and nurtured fully with The Everlasting Gospel, even of which Gospel your Holy Bibles were only the down payment that was given to keep you all for full redemption reserved for that approaching day that has come upon the entire world now! Truly, truly, Jacob will be fed and cared for and fully prepared for their purposes in my Millennial Kingdom, where truly no evil thing will ever enter.</p>
<p>Ready yourselves, my church, my body and even my bride for the full and final hour of your full and final redemption has come!</p>
<p>Ready yourselves my church my body and even my bride because so suddenly and unexpectedly now will you all find yourselves standing fully redeemed in the throne room of Adonai-YHVH himself where I will stand to present the Lights of the World to the Father of Lights, even a moment of excited expectation where Adonai-YHVH is more excited than all of you, and Adonai-YHVH has waited longer than you all combined! Therefore, I command you all to sit in excited expectation in full obedience to my commands, or I will strip rewards from the disobedient!</p>
<p>Therefore, I do command you, wherefore to stand firm and pass your final testing my loves, because even now I still stoke the flames of purification in your lives and I do fold you like metal in the hands of the perfect and righteous smith, because I am the smith who stokes the flames of purification, that truly my mighty and eternal works of salvation can root and strengthen into you fully, therefore, faint not my loves!</p>
<p>I am Yeshua HaMashiach, even Christ Jesus, and I do send these Words of announcement and expectation to my church, my body, and even my bride, so that you may understand that your expected gathering together to your excited Lord in the air is part of a larger plan of salvation, where your departure will happen exactly as announced to happen by my mighty hand and words given by my mighty messenger and servant, who is tuned to these same Words I have sewn into his spirit.</p>
<p>That as these Words are announced and given into this world for the first time ever, that truly their fulfillment begins as soon as they are announced and given into this world. Therefore, now, perhaps you can understand the foolishness of the unwise virgins who do not understand the Words of Adonai-YHVH! Because as these Words are given and spoken into the earth for the first time, their immediate fulfillment begins according to the everlasting will of Adonai-YHVH who works all things after the council of his own will, and who needs no counsellor.</p>
<p>Therefore, understand that while most mistake my messenger and servant's work as pastoral in nature, Biblaridion:144 is in fact an agent of declarative judgment and a chosen vessel to myself yet hidden in plain sight to call the faithful as my Shepherd whom I have commissioned and given full declarative and judicial authority over my church, my body, and even my bride and also Israel because I have placed his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the earth in all authority.</p>
<p>And I am Christ Jesus who is also Yeshua HaMashiach, even he who set apart and preserved my messenger and servant whom I have raised from his youth for my eternal purposes that are to be revealed fully at that mighty Harpazo, where I will rescue the faithful in Christ from one hour with the beast, and change you all eternally and forevermore for Adonai-YHVH's eternal purposes which he has placed in the face of Christ Jesus for full fulfillment within each and every one of you, my faithful, my dearly beloved and longed for!</p>
<p>And, so I give these Words, that perhaps you may understand how foolish many of you appear who are already in the process of being separated and redeemed, and yet who scream foolishly and faithlessly all the while demanding their own schedule of events, that is an impossibility to attain. Therefore, wait in all righteous expectation and peace, knowing full well that your full redemption is already underway and cannot be stopped, unless you apostatize in your impatience. Yet, I am persuaded better of my faithful because I will redeem you just as promised, and not a Word given by my hand, nor by the hand of Adonai-YHVH, the Great I AM will fall to the ground unfulfilled.</p>
<p>I am Jesus the Christ, even Yeshua the Messiah and I am coming for you my loves, therefore continue to wait, and purify yourselves in all righteous expectation. Fill your minds and hearts with the Words of my Little Book that I have opened in my messenger and servants hands, even so that all of you may feast in great peace and comfort on the Words of The Everlasting Gospel that have been given to keep you in the way, because your full redemption has arrived. If you will only allow yourselves to receive all I have prepared, even given by Adonal-YHVH himself in the face of Jesus Christ in reward for the faithful, who have so faithfully waited in great faith so they will now inherit the promises made to faithful Abraham who is the Father of the just who live by faith.</p>
<p>I am your everlasting Lord of Righteousness, even the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, and I do come to judge and make war. Therefore, prepare yourselves my warriors and prepare yourselves even according to the instructions I have left in this open little book that has been prepared, received, given, and announced by my little flock, and especially by my mighty messenger and servant whom I have separated from the Church for my purposes.</p>
<p>Truly, truly, I have hidden him in my quiver for such a time as this, except now have I lit his arrows, and his arrows ring true. Because my mighty messenger and servant is to be changed so suddenly and unexpectedly now because he is an agent of declarative judgment that will command the power contained in the seven thunders that I have sewn into his spirit, even which thunders do roar in him fully, because I have placed the roar and heart of The Lion of the Tribe of Judah into his recreated mind and heart, Selah.</p>
<p>Therefore, understand just who you are my warrior Bride, even my 144,000 because I have placed that same roar and heart into each of you, except I have created it in you uniquely to you, and according as your faithfulness has been. And you are my mighty warriors and nothing has ever been seen on earth, nor in all of Elohim's creation that can compare to what is to be revealed in you and what is to be accomplished by you my loves, only faint not and allow my full redemption to take root in your minds and hearts, even by your obedient patience and love to keep my commandments in all diligence.</p>
<p>Fret not over the date setters, neither fret over fables given by your Jesuit indoctrinators, that somehow there is three days of darkness coming that would actually identify that appointed day, time, and exact moment that was hidden by, yet now revealed in the heavens by the hand of Adonai-YHVH himself, although the disobedient amongst my faithful will not cease to spin their thoughts in futility to figure out what their Father himself has hidden from view. Obey!</p>
<p>Behold! I am coming for you, my loves, so stand fast and wait for me in all righteous expectation.</p>
<p>Behold! I am coming for you my loves, therefore, hide yourselves as commanded because the hour of your full redemption is here!</p>
<p>Behold! I am coming for you my loves, so stand fast in all obedience to my Words intended to keep and preserve you by the wayside as you wait in full expectation for my arrival, that is upon you, my loves.</p>
<p>Therefore, I command you to depart from all of the cares of this world, knowing, that although you do not see me with your own eyes, I do physically visit and sit with many of you in your own homes because I love you, and I will certainly gather you to myself. Do I surprise you my loves? Do you not understand that the earth is the Lords and the fullness thereof? You are my fullness my Bride, and I am with you always, therefore, focus your hearts fully on me, Christ Jesus and conduct yourselves as if your Lord is standing directly beside you in righteous observation. Because: I am!</p>
<p>Wherefore, ready yourselves, and hide yourselves away in the havens I have prepared for you, because one hour with the beast is now set to fall so suddenly and unexpectedly on the earth now that will utterly decimate Secret Babylon. Therefore, separate yourselves fully, in full expectation because I will snatch you to myself, because that Great Harpazo has come!</p>
<p>Hide yourselves from the unrighteous and those of Secret Babylon who are under judgment, because that judgment is coming for them, my loves. Hide yourselves so you do not partake of judgment that is not for you!</p>
<p>Behold! In my hand a mighty trumpet. A polished trumpet. A specially created trumpet, that is tuned to a special frequency created to find the faithful in Christ.</p>
<p>Behold! The faithful in Christ Jesus, even all those whom I have now tuned to the special frequency of that specially created and finely polished trumpet given in my hand by Adonai-YHVH himself.</p>
<p>Behold! Suddenly on the on earth you are not!</p>
<p>Behold! Judgment Falls! One hour with the beast has arrived! Suddenly, in the throne room of heaven you will all stand!</p>
