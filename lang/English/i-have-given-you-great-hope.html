<h1 id="ph">I Have Given You Great Hope!</h1>
<div id="prophecy">
<p>Come to me and hear my words, my Bride, for I am here to soothe your souls, comfort your hearts, and make you whole in me, Christ Jesus. Faint not at my words of reproof, for whom I love, I chasten, that your calling and election may be sure in me, the Bridegroom, even Christ Jesus. My children, lean your ears into my voice and hear my words, for I have not called you to judgment and condemnation, but have declared you righteous in me, even your Lord Jesus Christ. Have you not heard what Paul told the Corinthians in his first letter? And now abides faith, hope and love, even these three: but the chiefest of these is love. And so love is the greatest of these three, for Yahweh's love cannot be conquered. Yahweh's love is the glue that binds. It is the great motivator, and to give freely as you have freely received is being an imitator of God!</p>
<p>So many of you have lost hope, even your hope in me, Jesus Christ, for I have given you great hope, my children. Understand that the thief would confuse you and lead you astray, but God is not the author of confusion, but of peace as in all the churches of the saints. Satan has endeavored to obfuscate my precepts that I have given in my revelation of the Great Mystery of God to the Apostle Paul these many Jubilees past now. My children, your hope is the very concept that keeps you motivated to endure the many trials and tribulations you have in this life. For without your hope, you would be as Paul declared to the Corinthians: If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept. My children, I have given you great hope for your hope, for I have said: you which are alive and remain will be caught up in the clouds, as the dead in Christ will rise first, and you will all be changed, for so will you be like me evermore and so will my Bride be with me forevermore.</p>
<p>For what is your hope in Christ, my children? Is it not the promise of full redemption and restoration, where you will see heaven and the majesty and glory of Yahweh with your own eyes? Is your hope not a future where you will serve me in my kingdom of righteousness, for as you have been faithful over a few things, so I will make you ruler over many things. Is not your hope the promise of eternal life where you will eat from the tree of life and walk the streets of New Jerusalem, where the light of Yahweh and the light of Yeshua HaMashiach will forever shine in glorious brightness? Is your hope not a glory of many crowns and rewards for your faithfulness and love toward me, Christ Jesus? Is not your hope a hope of perfect health, no more sickness nor disease? Is not your hope that I will subject your enemies under your feet and to even make the synagogue of Satan bow at your feet? (For they will know I have loved you!) Is not your hope one of everlasting joy in the presence of Yahweh himself? For he will make his dwelling among men, and no longer will there be a divided kingdom, but the Kingdom of God only, for there is none greater than Yahweh; no, none can compare to the splendor of the great eternal God, even our Father!</p>
<p>Rejoice in your future, my children, for I have given you a future and a holy purpose in me, your shining Lord! Is not your hope a great hope where you are saved from wrath in me? For yours is even the greatest hope, the hope spoken of by my chosen vessel the Apostle Paul, the very steward of the great Mystery of God? For I revealed to Paul what he wrote to the Colossians: Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages, and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints, To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. Yours is a glorious hope fit for a king, for I will make you kings and priests before our God; for I am the high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek, and there will be no other.</p>
<p>My little ones, fear not the lies of the enemy, for he would exhaust you in futility if only he could; but he has met his match in me and I have defeated him fully, and I am coming to destroy his kingdom, for I was sent to undo the works of the Devil, and so I have sent you! The ancient serpent and all of his kingdom have no hope. They know they are condemned to everlasting destruction and punishment, where they will burn in the hottest flames of blue as they swim in burning brimstone forevermore. They are jealous of you and would give anything to be you, so don't listen to their words. Hear me, my Bride; Satan will do anything to lead you from your reward in me, Christ Jesus. He will do anything to cloak your hope that I have given you, and so his methods in this category many times are to cheapen the concept through counterfeiting the truth and by way of his lying tongue.</p>
<p>Fear him not, but depart from his lies and keep your true hope in mind, for have you not read? The spirit itself bears witness, with our spirit, that we are the children of God. And if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ: if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. For I reckon, that the sufferings of this present time, are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. My children, if only you understood the magnitude of what it means to be a joint heir with Christ, but you will soon know even as you are known. Do you not understand that God has given me all things in heaven and earth, and my inheritance is the greatest inheritance? My children, you simply don't know your true selves, for your true selves are hidden in me, and when I shall appear, so shall you appear with me in glory!</p>
<p>Fear not, and stay steadfast in your love and faith, for your hope will cause you to walk in great endurance; for what did my hope and joy the Father set before me cause me to accomplish? For Hebrews says: Looking unto Jesus the Author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. Have I not left you an example, and have I not become the type you should follow? Do you not understand? That he that believes in me will not only do the works that I accomplished during my first coming, but greater works than those I did? Because I have gone to the Father and I have empowered you and stand for you with all my might, for I am mighty, for so God has made me in my obedience.</p>
<p>My people, these words should encourage you and give you strength to stand, for I have set great joy before you! Do not believe the enemy's lies regarding your hope, for he would try to leave you hopeless and trampled underfoot, and even in your infirmities you are made mighty in me, your Lord Jesus Christ! I will now summarize your future, my Bride, so incline your ears to the words of my mouth, for they are words of faith, they are words of love, and my words will rekindle your hope in the truth, for great hope is in the truth I have given you!</p>
<p>First, understand that I have called you; I have saved you in my spirit of power and sonship; I have made you a new creation in me, Christ Jesus! On account of my sacrifice as the perfect Passover, all who believe on me in saving faith proceeding from their hearts will also be saved from wrath in me. My children, understand that these words are too wonderful for most people, for their sins beat them down into guilt, condemnation, and shame, and this happens because they many times refuse to cleanse themselves in my atoning blood, and they neglect to confess their sins, and they neglect their relationship with me, the prince of peace, for salvation comes from relational faith in me, the great Lord!</p>
<p>So many of you do not understand that I have justified you, and as a result of that justification in me, you are saved from wrath, for I told the Romans: Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. Answer me this, my Bride whom I am coming for, why do you desire the day of the Lord? Why have you listened to Satan's ministers who costume themselves as my ministers when they say you have to endure Jacob's trouble and even the great tribulation which occurs during the last half of Daniel's seventieth week? They lie to you and you believe them. They appeal to your sin nature, telling you that you are worthless when you are the pearl of great price; they tell you that you are worthy of great wrath in me, and they do lie! They tell you that you shouldn't expect to be delivered from tribulation, and they misquote my holy Word. For of a truth I told Paul the following to instruct Timothy: Persecutions, afflictions which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra, what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me. Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution. And verily, Satan will pursue all who live godly lives, and out of all his persecutions I will deliver you when you turn to me in your troubles and remain faithful in your hope. Understand the difference, for Satan has confused the matter: Satan will persecute all who live godly, and that is persecution; and many times you have to endure his wrath, for in his defeat he has great anger. But fear not his roar, for I instructed Peter, saying: Be sober, and watch: for your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: Whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren which are in the world.</p>
<p>Understand, my children, that the wrath to come is not Satan's wrath but the wrath of God and the wrath of the Lamb intended for Satan. For Satan is a coward who slithered his way all throughout the creation to try and hide himself from the wrath he has treasured, thinking he could defeat Yahweh in such matters; but the Father's purposes are stated thusly: Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? From whence then hath it tares? He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? But he said, Nay: lest while you gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest, I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. So shall the wheat be gathered in the barn, but the tares and all those who planted and watered them will be cast alive into that great lake of fire and brimstone that my Father has prepared for the Devil and his angels, but no part of God's wrath is for you, though Satan will try to shield himself behind you and will seek to carry you away captive as spoil. Fear not, for wrath is not for you. I understand many unstable souls wrest this parable, telling you that you will endure wrath with them, but they do so by ignoring scripture's clear order on the matter, and they endeavor to blind you by misquoting my parable.</p>
<p>Understand that I will snatch you away into the heavens, for I have prepared a place of safety and reward for my Bride; for in my Father's house will I hide you and there are many mansions. So yes, I will gather you together to me at my appearing, which is about to happen. For I stated to the Thessalonians: For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive, and remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore, comfort one another with these words. I ask you, my lied-to Bride, will you now reject the lies of Satan and cling to my words and take comfort in them and comfort your brethren? For so it soon shall be, and I long for your presence, for I love you dearly, for I am your Bridegroom.</p>
<p>Once you are taken from the earth, Jacob's trouble will break across the earth and great destruction will come suddenly, but it is not for you, as you will be taken to the heavens. And then shall you stand before my judgment seat that I may reward you according to your works. And to the faithful is great reward and many crowns, and you will be clothed in a house I have made for you, even a house that will be tailored just to you and will contain your many accomplishments, that I will endue with many abilities, for so is the new body I have waiting for you. No sickness, no pain, no sorrow, and no more curse, my children, for the curse will turn on the heads of the accursed. And so will you be in the heavens for that seven-year period, even Daniel's seventieth week. And then, you will ride with me as will all the host of heaven, for it is prophesied and so will it be: And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse, and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true, and in righteousness he does judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns, and he had a name written, that no man knew but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood, and his name is called, The word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.</p>
<p>My children, yours is a future of immeasurable glory, and you will never want again, for you have proven yourselves to me, and you require no further testing; so why would you need to endure Jacob's trouble? For its purpose is to save Jacob, for a remnant shall be saved. But rest assured, those who deny my appearing in their futile efforts to dash your true hope, even those same wayward shepherds, will endure Jacob's trouble, and they will be saved if they call on my name and are faithful to the end. But they will not have a place at my table, for to deny my appearing is to deny me, the Bridegroom, when I come for my Bride, and I am about to do just that.</p>
<p>Look for the brightness of my appearing! Listen, for you will hear my voice and the mighty trumpet blast of the last trump; for though I am the Lamb of God, I am coming as the Lion of Judah, and all of Satan's kingdom is gripped in fear of me, Christ Jesus, for their times have come, and the flames are stoked hot for them. But it will not come near you, for I have prepared great reward and great inheritance for you, my Bride. Read my words in the great book of Revelation, for I will show you a glimpse of your future: And round about the Throne were four and twenty seats, and upon the seats I saw four and twenty Elders sitting, clothed in white raiment, and they had on their heads crowns of gold. (and again) And when those beasts give glory, and honor, and thanks to him that sat on the Throne, who lives forever and ever, The four and twenty Elders fall down before him that sat on the Throne, and worship him that lives for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the Throne, saying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honor, and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are, and were created.</p>
<p>My children, fear not your future, but look to me in great anticipation, for very soon you will be in the heavens casting your crowns before the throne of the most high God!</p>
<div class="indent">
<p>I am the righteous judge and soon you will receive great reward at my Bema.</p>
<p>I am the Bridegroom to my bride.</p>
<p>I am coming to catch away my Bride!</p>
<p>I am the Lion of the Tribe of Judah and the world is about to understand.</p>
<p>I am he that is given preeminence in heaven and earth, for my name is greater than all names except Yahweh.</p>
<p>I am the Son of God come in the flesh for the sins of mankind, and I was raised the third day and received into the heavens.</p>
<p>I am he who will rule in righteousness on the earth, and my Bride will rule with me.</p>
<p>I am he who has called you to glory and virtue, so faint not!</p>
<p>I am.</p>
