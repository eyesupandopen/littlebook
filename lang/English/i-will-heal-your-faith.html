<h1 id="ph">I Will Heal Your Faith, says the Great Lord!</h1>
<div id="prophecy">
<p>Behold! I, even I, Christ Jesus the risen Lord and savior of the world, have a question for you, my bride. Will you answer me honestly? Will you be able to provide an answer to me suitable for the record of truth? So, I will ask you: When the son of man comes, suppose ye, that I shall find faith on earth? Obviously this is a rhetorical question, but if you had to stand at my call to answer, what would it be? Would you speak to me of your faith and how marvelous it is? Will you tell me of your positive thoughts, whereby you foolishly think you control the world by your thoughts? Do you not realize that the most basic tenets in my faith, even the faith of Jesus Christ, even those most basic tenets have been counterfeited and redefined as falsehoods? But you foolishly say: "Oh, God would never let that happen!" As to which I ask you, how well do you know God? Are you his counselor? Will you stand forth and command Yahweh? Will you stand forth and command me, Yeshua HaMashiach, to do your bidding? Yet many of you foolishly try to do just that, for you have been deceived in a very grievous manner.</p>
<p>You have allowed false prophets, even the very tares Satan has planted in his false churches (that are not of me), these very same false prophets of whom my brother Jude spoke as I inspired my words in his heart and as I moved his spirit within him in holy inspiration: Woe unto them, for they have gone in the way of Cain and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Korah. These false ones walk openly among you, and many of you follow them, thinking instead you are following me, for they are counterfeit, and they try to mimic my voice so that the naive among my sheep might follow them into great error, of which they are. For what else did Jude say of these worthless ones? These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds, trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots. Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame, wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever.</p>
<p>I know the counterfeit is convincing to some of you, for some of you do not truly know me but endeavor to worship Yahweh and follow me, your Lord Jesus Christ, via the tenets of the prosperity gospel. Make no mistake: The prosperity gospel is a lie, and I never gave myself as your Passover lamb so you could gather riches to yourselves: For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. Many of you have followed one of many counterfeit gospels, but there is no other gospel. Many of you have followed one of many counterfeit Christs, but there is no other Christ but me, Yeshua HaMashiach. I say to you plainly, you have been deceived, and many of you have traded the true faith of Jesus Christ for a false faith. A false faith and a lying faith where the very word faith (have I not given you the true Word of Faith?) no longer means trust, belief, and steadfastness in Yahweh, your Father, and me, Jesus Christ your Lord, but has been redefined to worthless extremes and fairy tales and occultic magical thinking. You have let the worthless ones lead you astray, and your churches have been infiltrated by satanists, the very tares the evil one planted among you.</p>
<p>These extremes boil down to positive and negative thinking, and you foolishly think that whatever you meditate on long enough will come to pass, as if God had placed his power and favor to those with the most false faith, where you command the elements by your thinking. Do you not understand that all who practice such vanities are caught and ensnared and held captive to their lusts and these falsehoods, even chained to failure, for you are ignorantly following Satan's ways? Understand it was the fallen angels, yes, the Satans and the watchers who joined them, who taught mankind witchcraft, root cutting, spells, and enchantments; and many evil men have infiltrated my Laodicean church and have carried away many as spoil who have believed their lies.</p>
<p>This has happened because many in my Laodicean church refuse to stand and fight in righteousness so that you may overcome evil with good! Let me help you understand the truth. None of you have any power and ability of yourselves, for it is in your weakness when you finally realize the futility of your own efforts. Then, many times, you understand that when you rely on me, Christ Jesus, and follow my directions in the path I have chosen for you, that you rely on me and my power and have full faith in me. For I will prove to all of you in my own way, when you stay meek to my voice and turn when I tell you to, that in your own efforts and power you are nothing but a grain of sand in the desert, lost with the storms, and I did not die to rescue sand but the red earth of Adam, for I am the last Adam, and I am a life-giving spirit. However, in me Christ Jesus, you are powerful and unstoppable, for you have this treasure in earthen vessels, and I will grant many miracles, signs, wonders and the like at your hands when you have relational faith in me, Jesus Christ, instead of faith in yourselves. Please allow me to lead you, and quit the lies of the fallen ones, for by their actions great wrath is treasured against them in the day of wrath, whereby their end is consumed in fire and burning brimstone.</p>
<p>Understand how this deception was achieved, because in recent Jubilees there was a false enlightenment where those whom your society reckons great rejected God in favor of their own futile reasoning. They even made an idol of reason during their revolution; are you ignorant of history? These wells without water with their corrupted and vain philosophies disallowed God and erroneously taught that God was a mere passive observer who is not really interested in mankind but provides all from afar and allows mankind to figure it out, with God's favor going to the strongest sorcerer amongst them. Then, over time, many unstable souls, even the very tares of Satan, infiltrated my Laodicean church to consummate their lies in the proper times and season. They infiltrated you with good words and fair speeches and taught the power of magical thinking to my Bride, and many amongst my Body greedily followed them, for their greed was piqued.</p>
<p>These evil sons of Satan stealthily mingled witchcraft into my doctrines and achieved to pollute my holy Word with leaven, except my Word cannot be polluted by their fictions, for their lies stand on lies. Do you not understand that a little leaven leavens the entire lump? Do you not understand that the leaven of Herod and the leaven of the Pharisees are not the only ways of corruption? For you have been enchanted by the leaven of Christian witchcraft! Therefore, REPENT! For what did I tell the Corinthians by the Apostle Paul's hand? Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us. Hear my Words! So these brute beasts, these wells without water, even the worthless and toxic tares preached and started their own fake Christian sects, cults even, stealing many of those who would follow them from the true Church, where I care for my Bride in love and grace and mercy, leading them from me into false houses of worship secretly dedicated to Baal, for your nation is Secret Babylon!</p>
<p>As if this wasn't bad enough, many powerful and wealthy sorcerers paid much money and spent much effort placing their lies into fake Bibles. They brought out Alexandrian, gnostic texts, causing my Church to become double minded from the single focus of the texts I preserved from Antioch, even certain reference Bibles where these lies were added to the margins. These books were then introduced into your corrupt seminaries and became the default study Bibles for these false prophets who have falsely preached lies ever since, and they will pay to the fullest. Since that time, your lands are filled with false churches led by ravenous wolves, and still so many of my sheep erroneously think they can keep company with wolves. Your fake churches are houses of blasphemy; they are houses of entertainment where they sing praises to Satan right in front of you, and you lack the spiritual discernment to see. There are many lords amongst the Devil's kingdom, and they sing Lord, Lord to them, except when they say to me Lord, Lord, I will say, Depart from me, you workers of iniquity for I never knew you.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, they took the blasphemous prosperity gospel and further morphed it by introducing self-help psychology, and what have I said regarding such matters: Beware lest any man come and spoil you through philosophy and deceitful vanity, through the traditions of men, and ordinances after the world, and not after Christ. These fake churches are corrupt with no redeeming value, and many are founded by evil builders who are free from me, the chief cornerstone, and all their structures will fall into the shifting sand. These are blasphemous builders and false stone cutters and false bricklayers who have rejected the chief cornerstone, and they have no truth in them! They even flaunt their symbols in your so-called houses of worship, where they mock you openly. Hear the Proverb I have for you, for it is true and will bring true enlightenment to your souls: A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth. He winks with his eyes, he speaks with his feet, he teaches with his fingers.</p>
<p>Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually, he soweth discord. And so they are and so they do before your very eyes, but you cannot see, for you are blinded in their false doctrines and froward ways.</p>
<p>My children, come out from among them and separate yourselves; for what concord has Christ with Belial. Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, and utterly separate yourselves from them. For you, my Laodicean church, even you are lukewarm and spineless, and these are not my ways not in the least, for I chased the money changers out of the Temple in my zeal for Yahweh. Return to me, Jesus Christ, the true shepherd and physician of your souls, and learn of me. For positive confessions and worthless positive thinking are not of me, but lies whispered to you by false apostles, even the very ministers of Satan who have transformed themselves into the ministers of righteousness. Run to me, my little ones, for times is up, and you ignorantly think you have all the time in the world, and you have just a short few minutes to repent and return to me in humility that I might still yet set a place for you at my table and that I might still open a door in the heavens for you that you may enter into the pleasure of your Lord!</p>
<p>For many of you think you will be gathered to me when you live these lies and when you eat the filth the false prophets feed you, blasphemously in my name. Know that I didn't send them and their words are not of me, and if you don't depart from them, you will have to prove yourselves to me in much trial and testing during Jacob's trouble, which has come upon the entire world and is about to be unleashed! Look on me in your spirit; focus, for you can sense the birth pangs in your spirit, for I am calling you home and my Bride is about to be delivered. Behold, I leave with you the letter I sent to you, my Laodiceans, for in these words are illuminated the path to return to me; and if you will but hearken, I will restore your reward to you, and you will sup with me at my table in the heavens that I have prepared for my Bride.</p>
<p>And unto the messenger of the congregation, which is in Laodicea, write: Thus saith (Amen) the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creatures of God. I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot. I would thou were cold or hot. So then because thou art between both, and neither cold nor hot. I will, spew you out of my mouth: because thou art rich and increased with goods, and hast need of nothing, and knowest not how thou art wretched and miserable, poor, blind and naked. I counsel you to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich, and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, that thy filthy nakedness do not appear, and anoint thine eyes with eye salve, that thou may see. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Be fervent, therefore, and repent. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in unto him, and will sup with him, and he with me. To him that overcomes will I grant to sit with me in my seat, even as I overcame and have sat with my Father, in his seat.</p>
<p>Behold!</p>
<div class="indent">
<p>I am he that walks amongst the seven lampstands, so return to me, lest I take your candlestick from you.</p>
<p>I am the good shepherd who gave himself for the flock.</p>
<p>I am he that will rule the earth from David's throne and will smite the nations with a rod of iron.</p>
<p>I am he who is worthy to take the book and break the seals.</p>
<p>I am he who commands the angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God, for they will seal my 144,000, even the servants of the living God.</p>
<p>I am he who will stand on Mount Zion with my 144,000, and they will sing a new song that no man can learn.</p>
<p>I am Lord of Lords and King of Kings, and I do come to make war on the kings of the earth, for their time has come.</p>
<p>I am he who is coming for my Bride, for my appearing is at hand. Ready yourselves, my Bride!</p>
