<h1 id="ph">The Fulfillment of All Things!</h1>
<div id="prophecy"> 
<p>Hear the Words of your living Lord and Savior, even your true Messiah, even Yeshua HaMashiach. Understand and listen to my Words my children for I will now speak regarding the fulfillment of all things, for their fulfillment is at hand. So understand, because mankind has now rejected Yahweh's peace treaty and rejected Jesus the Nazarene (for I am your peace treaty) the seasons on earth will now change from grace to judgment, will now change from mercy to calamity, will now change from peace to war, will now change from gentleness to wrath, will now change to all out vengeance and utter destruction for those who dwell on the earth. Even all those who have refused to make me Lord and accept my love and forgiveness for them, whereby I would have restored them to their creator and given them life eternal, never to die again.</p>
<p>But instead of natural man coming to me fully, many have refused in rebellious arrogance choosing instead to remain with the Satans and their rebellion and have by default joined them either in ignorance, or knowing full well their choice. And so those who have so foolishly chosen will now be subject to the wrath of God and the wrath of the lamb that is so soon to be poured out in full. And even though many have at this time refused, a multitude of multitudes will come to me and confess Jesus as Lord and will call on the name of their Messiah until the end. And so by virtue of Yeshua HaMashiach will they yet be saved. Yet many more will perish, even all those whose names were never written in the Book of Life slain from the foundations of the world and so will be their choice.</p>
<p>And so in the same manner as these changes are happening on earth in judgment, peace has settled over the heavens and war will now utterly consume the earth. There was war in heaven and the accuser of the brethren is cast down, is cast down, and that great red dragon is now bound to the earth and is awaiting his judgment and his judgment lingers not. In utter defeat will he serve his purposes in Yahweh's eternal plans, for even his enemies obey his voice, and so is given him only in a very limited manner and his kingdom will be utterly destroyed. Behold! That old serpent, even that great red dragon, is now cast down to the earth, and he has great wrath because he knows that he has but a short time! And so I, Yeshua HaMashiach do counsel one and all to run towards the sound of my voice and call on my mighty name to the end for those who love not their lives to the end will awaken to eternal splendor, joy, and reward and great is their reward! For all who call on my name to the end will be saved, in whatever language they call and I Jesus Christ, who am also Yeshua HaMashiach, declare these words!</p>
<p>And so covenants and promises of old will be fulfilled, even all covenants for all time for so is the everlasting gospel. And as war settles over the earth, peace is now established in the heavens where the heavens are now prepared to receive the faithful in Christ, even those who have died faithful in Christ, and those who are alive and remain and live their lives in Christ. For all who walk by the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus in my age of grace will be gathered and receive their eternal reward and will understand and will be set in their orders to fulfill Yahweh's eternal purpose for which they are created newly in Christ. And so the wedding of the Bridegroom to the Bride will now take place, and there will be great celebration in the heavens in eternal splendor and glory!</p>
<p>For from the beginning, God created Adam, and from Adam he created Eve so she would be his eternal companion and to be the mother of all the living and that they would be fruitful and multiply. They were commanded that of all the trees in the garden of Eden, they may freely eat from any tree except the tree of knowledge of good and evil. And so with the crafty temptation of the serpent Eve was deceived, and she took of the forbidden fruit and did eat, and she gave to her husband Adam, and he knowingly ate and thus sin corrupted mankind and in dying they have died ever since. And so Adam and Eve never fulfilled their high calling to rule and subdue the earth in righteousness and to be fruitful and multiply and to cover the earth in righteousness but instead sinned and lived the wages of sin until those wages culminated in their deaths and in dying mankind has died ever since. And in the resurrection of the just will they receive their reward and recompense for they were faithful to the end.</p>
<p>And so it is that Yahweh, in his eternal foreknowledge, knew before it happened that mankind would choose sin and death for himself from the beginning. And El Shaddai, even in his great love wherewith he loves mankind, (and all his creation), provided unfathomable grace and mercy when he declared that he would put enmity between Satans seed and the seed of the woman. Satans seed did bruise my heel at Calvary in fulfillment of Yahweh's Words and I will now move to utterly crush the head of the serpent for so is his future and all who follow, and as it has been written, so it will continue to be done to completion.</p>
<p>Yet, God has chosen in his infinite wisdom to reveal his plans of grace, mercy, and peace for mankind's full redemption in increments, and yet has always given great hope for the righteous that one day soon they would be raised to newness of life from the dead never to die again, and they would live in plenteousness and peace all the days of their lives and of which days there shall be no end. Over the ages the faithful have died with full faith in Yahweh to fulfill his promises and they have died trusting Yahweh's covenants as their hope of salvation and all of Yahweh's covenants will be fully fulfilled in the face of Christ Jesus, even me, your risen Lord and Savior. And so they believed God and to them it was accounted for righteousness even for all those who believed and had hope in the promised seed of the woman.</p>
<p>And so Yahweh's plan of the ages for mankind's full redemption has always centered on me, Christ Jesus even Jesus the Nazarene who is also Yeshua HaMashiach for I am the ascended Lord of Lords who is the lamb of God and who has brought eternal salvation to Judean and Gentile alike, and I will yet save Jacob from those who have invaded the land of promise and their destruction lingers not. I am he in whom the lion will lie down with the lamb for in me the lion of the tribe of Judah and the lamb of God will come to full completion. For I am the lion of the tribe of Judah and I am the Lamb of God for I am King of Kings and Lord of Lords and I am the High Priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.</p>
<p>And so Adam and Eve lived faithfully going forward before the Lord their God, and they were fruitful and did multiply, yet Satan would engineer yet another attack with the rebellion of the fallen watchers. They joined the Satans rebellion and to satisfy their own lusts left the eternal glory of their first estate, of which they were created, to defile themselves with women, even with flesh and blood, for they would have remained in eternal splendor but instead chose their own eternal punishment in order to fulfill their lusts at the expense and death of the creation that then was.</p>
<p>And so these fallen angels taught fallen man how to destroy himself through the lineage of Cain and through the forbidden knowledge and manipulations they taught mankind. They posed as gods and demanded worship and TOOK to themselves wives by force from all they chose, and many women volunteered themselves at the direction of the Satans in order to tempt and entice the watchers into their lustful sins of which they bound themselves eternally to their own curse for they made amongst themselves mutual imprecations. This happened in the days of Jared and their abominations, even their Nephilim spread over the earth in their worldwide empire during their so-called golden age.</p>
<p>And the watchers and their seed did corrupt the earth and all that was therein and strange genetic mutations of all sorts were made and abounded in the earth for they sinned against all flesh and their lusts knew no bounds, and they pretended to be gods, even gods who create but in reality they are nothing but pretenders who partook in gross cross-breeding between species. And so the earth became utterly corrupt and was ruled by Nephilim, who consumed men and the acquisitions of men. And all that were left undefiled at the time of Noah (for Noah was just and upright and walked with Yahweh and found favor in Yahweh's sight) were eight souls saved alive with the animals Yahweh brought to the Ark for their species salvation. And so God flooded the earth and all corruption from the world that then was perished, and the watchers have no peace, nor forgiveness and eternally and forevermore will their harsh judgment be for they are worthy. And not the watchers only, but all who join themselves to the Satans rebellion will suffer in such manner and be recompensed eternally in that great lake of fiery blue brimstone that burns the hottest and purest flames of punishment.</p>
<p>After the flood, God established the world that now is, even established at the first in righteousness. And Yahweh entered into covenant with Noah, where Yahweh invited Noah to raise up righteousness on the earth and be fruitful and multiply that the promised seed of the woman may come. Yahweh promised never to flood the earth again and in spite of mankind's evil nature, God worked with mankind to protect and bless the righteous bloodlines on earth of which I Yeshua HaMashiach arose.</p>
<p>God blessed them to be fruitful and multiply and to replenish the earth, and God promised both man and beast that he would never again destroy all flesh from the earth by water and never again would El Shaddai flood the entire earth but would preserve the earth, and preserve mankind and his seed, and this same world is preserved from that day of covenant where the Father of Lights set his bow in the heavens as a token and reminder of his covenant with Noah. For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water: Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished: But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.</p>
<p>And so Yahweh raised up Abram to become Abraham, and he promised Abram that his name would no longer be Abram but Abraham and that he would make him a Father of many nations and that he would give to Abraham and to his seed the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession and that Yahweh would be their God! And so Abraham became a Father of many nations, of which Yahweh promised in covenant. Now, to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He says not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which is Christ. And so the just shall live by faith!</p>
<p>And so the children fell into bondage in Egypt after the children of promise went there under Joseph's protection and sustenance for Joseph ruled righteously under Pharaoh who was greater than Joseph in the throne, but Joseph served the great I AM! There arose a pharaoh who knew not Joseph, and these tares suppressed and endeavored to kill the Christ line yet once again, even the children of promise. And Yahweh raised up a Hebrew deliverer from the house of Pharaoh, even he who was drawn out of the water and saved alive by Yahweh's grace. It was Moses himself who would lead the children of promise out of bondage into the glorious liberty of the land of promise, for they are the children of promise and I will yet raise them from their sleep and reward the faithful and righteous richly, even those who stayed faithful to the end. And so Moses delivered the children of Israel from the hand of their oppressors and all who pursued them drowned in the sea, for who is able to stand against El Shaddai?</p>
<p>And so Yahweh led Moses and the children of promise to Mount Sinai where Yahweh gave precepts, commandments and ordinances contained in laws to Moses for obedience of all the children. And blessings and curses were established for obedience and for disobedience. And when Yahweh had given in covenant to Moses the commandments contained in ordinances for obedience, Moses then ratified the covenant into a Testament by the shedding of blood. And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins, and half of the blood he sprinkled on the Altar. And he took the book of the covenant, and read to the audience of the people: and they said, All that the Lord has said, will we do, and be obedient. And Moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the Covenant which the Lord hath made with you, concerning all these words. Moreover, he sprinkled with blood both the Tabernacle, and all the vessels of the Ministry. And almost all things are by the Law purged with blood: and without shedding of blood is no remission of sins.</p>
<p>And so history unfolded as written, and in time the nation of Israel was fully established, yet there still was no dwelling for Yahweh among the people. And Yahweh raised up a righteous King, even a man after God's own heart! In the course of time Yahweh sent Nathan the Prophet to David and told him that when your days are fulfilled, and you will sleep with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son. And your house and your kingdom will be established forever before you: your throne will be established forever. According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</p>
<p>And so mankind has followed Yahweh from covenant to covenant adding onto covenant which was ratified by the sacrifice of animals and covenant was added to testament. Yet, for mankind's best efforts he of his own ability could never live up to the righteousness of God, even that just and righteous law of Moses of which I love and fulfilled. Should any call the law of Moses and the many covenants of Yahweh accursed, let him be accursed. For the law is good and just and holy and all the promises of Yahweh are yea and amen. Yet, the law was given as a schoolmaster to bring them to Christ. For I, Jesus the Nazarene am who Yahweh has given to fulfill that which mankind is incapable due to the sin passed on from generation to generation from the blood of Adam, which is corrupted evermore. For what the law could not do in as much as it was weak because of the flesh: that performed God, and sent his son in the likeness of sinful flesh.</p>
<p>So in the fullness of times I, Jesus the Nazarene, was born of a woman according to the requirements of Mosaic law and in fulfillment of covenants, and I am the promised seed of the woman foretold by Yahweh himself these many ages ago. For God so loved the World that he gave his only begotten son, that whoso believes on him should not perish, but have everlasting life. And so I am the only begotten son of God, even that seed of promise of which the prophets have prophesied of old until now. And I am he who is set for the fulfillment of all things and in me, Christ Jesus, will all things and all promises come to fulfillment and not one promise will be left undone, but all will be fulfilled for all time.</p>
<p>For it is written in Hebrews where I had Paul write: For if the blood of Bulls, and of goats, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh: How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit, offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works, to serve the living God? And for this cause he is the Mediator of the New Testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first Testament, they which are called, might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.</p>
<p>So understand that in me, Christ Jesus are the promises of old kept and the covenants of old kept and the testament of old is kept and fulfilled for I am their perfect fulfillment. And yet there are still promises to be fulfilled and now are the times of fulfillment. For so are the times, where I will suddenly raise from sleep those who have fallen asleep in Christ, and I will suddenly gather those who are alive and remain to meet me in the clouds and suddenly will we be united in the throne room of Yahweh himself. For you my Church and even my bride are also the fulfillment of covenantal promise and you are born again of incorruptible seed and redeemed by the many promises in my New Testament, which is a new covenant that embodies every promise of covenants of old and even adds exceeding great and precious promises whereby you are redeemed to everlasting life and everlasting reward and forever will we be together.</p>
<p>Understand that the lives you have lived in the flesh, even you my faithful and chosen, those lives are at an end at your full redemption. Understand that you are fully identified with me, Christ Jesus, on every level. When I was crucified for your sins, you were also crucified with me. When I died on that rugged stake, you also died with me. When I was raised to life after three days and three nights in the heart of the earth so to were you raised to newness of life, and when I was ascended to the heaven of the heavens so to were you ascended with me and so you are seated in the heavenlies. For I am your perfect Passover, and I am your substitute who took your place in judgment and deserved punishment. And I, Jesus the Nazarene, willingly redeemed you from the curse of the law because of your sinful flesh you are never able to fulfill the law of your own efforts.</p>
<p>Understand that I did not come to destroy the law, nor covenants, but to fulfill all in the times of fulfillment. Should any call the law of Moses and the many covenants of Yahweh accursed, let him be accursed. For the law is good and just and holy, and all the promises of Yahweh are yea and amen. Yet, the law was given as a schoolmaster to bring them to Christ. For I, Jesus the Nazarene, am who Yahweh has given to fulfill that which mankind is incapable due to the sin passed on from generation to generation from the blood of Adam, which is corrupted evermore. For what the law could not do in as much as it was weak because of the flesh: that performed God, and sent his son in the likeness of sinful flesh.</p>
<p>Every promise is about to be fully realized and fulfilled in me Christ Jesus and I will enter marriage covenant with my Bride that together they will rule with me in my inheritance and they will, by my lead and with me, heal the earth and go forth and rule as priests and kings in the earth and every covenant will be fulfilled from Adam to Moses in the Face of Jesus Christ. These are the promises of eternal life that will be fulfilled in the righteous, even all those who become recreated as one new man in Christ Jesus. For all will be recreated fully and rewarded eternally for their portion and all shall be yea and amen. For every yod, and every thorn of a yod will be fulfilled utterly and for all time.</p>
<p>Understand that you are the temple of the living God, my faithful Church and I have created you as a house made without hands so that you may be an eternal dwelling place of the everlasting God, even of Yahweh your Father. And I will wed my bride and will forever be with them in eternal covenant, that where I am, so to will they be, and forevermore will they be like me, Christ Jesus their eternal Lord. And understand my faithful that the times of separation are at a close and there will be no more separation between Yahweh and his beloved sons and there will be no more separation between Christ Jesus your eternal Lord and those whom I dearly love. Understand that we will move as one man and there will be no sin nor hindrance. You will do many mighty works that have not even entered into the hearts of men. You will be my mighty kings and priests of which I am King of Kings and Lord of Lords and we will rule the earth in righteousness.</p>
<p>And many more will be raised to life at the conclusion of Daniel's seventieth week and they will all be rewarded according as their faithfulness has been. And all who have died faithful in expectation that their Lord and Messiah would not leave their souls in the grave will awaken to newness of life and eternal restoration. For I will connect them with their loved ones and I will restore to them what the locusts have eaten and I will restore to them what Satan stole from them during the times they were strangers on the earth awaiting their full redemption from this fallen and evil world.</p>
<p>And so is the everlasting gospel and evermore will all things be fulfilled in righteousness, holiness, and truth. For nothing will enter the gates of my kingdom that is defiled or evil or that loves and makes lies but in truth and everlasting righteousness will my rule be. So hear the voice of Yeshua HaMashiach even all to whom these words are sent. Your everlasting Lord has not forgotten the promises of Old nor have any testaments come to nothing. But all will be fulfilled and indeed, much has already been fulfilled so look to those things for hope. For as it is written so shall it be done and so is the everlasting gospel in these times of fulfillment.</p>
<div class="indent">
<p>I Yeshua HaMashiach have sent these Words by my servant and by me servant have these words been sent.</p>
<p>I am the promised seed of the woman.</p>
<p>I am your peace treaty.</p>
<p>I am the ascended Lord of Lords who is the lamb of God.</p>
<p>I am he in whom the lion will lie down with the lamb.</p>
<p>I am the lion of the tribe of Judah.</p>
<p>I am the Lamb of God.</p>
<p>I am King of Kings and Lord of Lords.</p>
<p>I am the High Priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.</p>
</div>
<p>So I give you to understand that the fulfillment of all things is here and is already underway. Those of my bride and body will serve and live newness of life alongside those who will be resurrected in righteousness at the resurrection of the just after Daniel's seventieth week. And in righteousness and peace will we live in harmony with God's creation and there will be an enduring and everlasting peace for the children of promise, and they shall serve one another, and they shall serve me, and they shall serve Yahweh and in peace and harmony will Yahweh's creation be restored.</p>
<p>For there yet remains a rest to God's people. And so as my age of grace comes to a close the final age is nearly here my children, even that last day when we will all rest from our labors and troubles, and we will enjoy the fat of the land as we rest in the day of rest even a Sabbath day of harmony will there be. There have been six days of labor, for one day is with the Lord as a thousand year and a thousand years as a day. Thus, in my thousand-year reign will the faithful spend a day of rest with their creator, Father, and Everlasting God before Yahweh creates a new heaven and a new earth wherein will only ever dwell everlasting righteousness. Behold, the times are now, so be ready!</p>
