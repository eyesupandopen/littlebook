<h1 id="ph">Prophetic Reception Method: How I Receive Prophetic Messages</h1>
<div id="prophecy"> 
<p>On March 2, 2024, the Lord Jesus Christ began giving me prophetic messages to share with people regarding his imminent appearing for his Church and other topics. These prophecies came to me in what the Bible describes as when "the hand of the Lord" rests on an individual. For me, it's a deep feeling of heaviness in my spirit, one that will not leave until I finish the message. Christ will impress a few words or phrases in my mind that I can't shake and won't forget, and many times I text the phrase to myself so that I remember. When I do sit down and start typing, the Lord will literally show me the Words in my spirit as I type: Yes, at times I have actual visual perceptions of the words, and many times I hear the words as I type, not audibly but in my spirit, and it's perceived in such a way that is undeniable.</p>
<p>When I make a mistake and type my own thoughts, the words stop until I delete what I added. When I doubt myself and delete a phrase Christ intended to keep, the words stop until I put the sentence back the way it was, and that sentence will not leave my mind until I do. Lately, the Lord has given me very deep doctrinal messages, and he has taken me to specific scriptures. He will put a phrase in my spirit and I will type it out; then I will search the phrase in my Bible, and I will find that the phrase is in a section of scripture. At that point he will indicate to me which scriptures I need to quote, and I will paste them in the narrative, and then the words continue right away. I'm still amazed that the Words the Lord gives me are in perfect harmony with the blocks of scripture he gives me to quote, and the scripture I quote flows with the narrative most times in a way I simply cannot achieve on my own. I have never done anything like this in my life, until now. I typically do not know the fullness of the message until I go back and perform a spelling and punctuation check. At that point I will read it again, and the Lord will have me make minor changes, perhaps add a sentence for clarification, perhaps delete a word and replace it with another, and so forth. Then the heaviness leaves and I know I am finished.</p>
<p>Please note that in all of these prophetic messages, I have never changed anything topical, not ever, not once; and there has never been a major change to content, not ever, not once. The longer prophecies typically take around an hour or less to type, and the refining process may add another hour or two. I do check everything with scripture to make sure I didn't mangle anything in my human understanding. So far I haven't, but to be clear: Many of these Words are beyond my understanding when I type them, and I need to go to scripture to learn more based on what I received. Never once have the messages contradicted scripture, though they challenge my understanding of scripture, and I am a student as well. Now, I am a minister and have close to 30 years in scripture and have made many sermons, teachings, and so on. Let me say this from my years of experience: It is impossible for me to type anything of this level and detail in that short amount of time of my own efforts and understanding. It takes me several days, sometimes a week or more, to prepare a longer, detailed sermon, and this is not the same, not at all. This is not of me and is beyond my understanding. The spirit of prophecy has fallen on me, for the Testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</p>
