<p>How art you fallen from heaven, O Heylel, son of the morning? and cut down to the ground, which didst cast lots upon the nations?</p>
<p>Yet you said in your heart, I will ascend into heaven, and exalt my throne above beside the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the North. I will ascend above the height of the clouds, and I will be like the most high. But you shall be brought down to the grave, to the side of the pit.</p>

<h3 class="h3otsikko" id="key1"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro1"></span>Key Declarations from William Brooks, even Yeshua HaMashiach's Biblaridion</h3>
<span class="spectral">Given July 6, 2025</span>
<p>This document is a declarative judgment on The Fallen Ones collectively, but specifically Satan, The Satans, the watchers, the fallen cherubim, the fallen seraphim, even all who have joined the Satans' rebellion: you will utterly burn, over and over again for all eternity, for so has been declared by YHVH the Great I AM, given by command of Christ Jesus, who is also Yeshua HaMashiach; given in an abridged, yet detailed and accurate list of offenses and judgments to be executed and fulfilled fully in their times and the times of fulfillment have come: Behold Judgment Falls! Even declarative judgments to be fully given into the bosoms of the fallen ones in full, even a multitude of times over and for all eternity and forevermore, you have no peace, even all you fallen ones: Selah.</p>
<p>And so I, William Brooks, even Christ Jesus' very own Biblaridion:144, I do give these judgments which are drawn specifically from the Seven Thunders, specifically, which thunderous judgments are to be read directly, and given for all to understand, and so these Words may be fully understood by these fallen entities themselves who have condemned themselves eternally and forevermore in senseless rebellion, of which condemnation they shall not recover, nor overcome!</p>
<p>Hear the Words of Yeshua HaMashiach even whose Words I come to declare, even he who is also Christ Jesus and hear and understand the resonant authority of the Lion of The Tribe of Judah, even whose roar he created in my heart and whose roar emanates from my mouth, even which roaring Lion of The Tribe of Judah I do love, and obediently serve and do follow even, in all restraint, even of which Lion has placed his thunderous roar within the depths of my being because I am his messenger who comes in great authority, and I do raise my hand and swear that time shall be no more!</p>
<p>Behold! I am who and what the Lord Jesus Christ has made me, even he whom Yeshua HaMashiach raised from his youth, and even hidden in his quiver for such a time as this, Selah!</p>
<p>Behold! A command given in song from the throne of YHVH himself and so it was sung in great faith in times of old: Touch not mine anointed, and do my Prophets no harm! Went the musical cry now preserved in the holy writings.</p>
<p>Yet as it is written: Which of the Prophets have not your fathers persecuted? And they have slain them, which showed before of the coming of that Just, of whom you are now the betrayers and murderers!</p>
<p>For you! O' fallen serpent. You! Even You! Is he who has slain the innocent blood of that Just and righteous and holy Son of Man, even Jesus the Nazarene, that spotless lamb of God given for the full redemption of Adam, and so I declare in the full authority of my Lord, even Christ Jesus: You have failed little prince and your judgment lingers not, even the same judgment whose fingers are extended across your neck and you are held in defeated subjection, you have failed little prince, you have failed: Selah!</p>
<p>And so it is, even the very same messenger and servant who was fractured and split unjustly by your wiles, even blinded from his true self in his youth and who is now recreated, and freed and sent with your eternally binding and everlasting judgments in hand given from the throne of YHVH himself, even declared in full authority in that eternally beautiful face of his Everlasting Lord and savior, even whose face shines eternally as the Son!</p>
<p>You have failed little prince.</p>
<p>So, know and understand and hear my words Heylel, even Heylel: that failed little prince, even the same messenger and servant whom you sought to nullify in fractured shards of resonant light strewn across the crystal sea have been recovered, restored, and recreated as Christ Jesus' Biblaridion:144, even recreated with the same eternal intentions YHVH intended before the foundations of the World, and for his purposes have I been recreated and restored because I am even that mighty messenger described by that thunderous end time message which is governed by the voice and utterance of the Seven Thunders, even which Thunders Yeshua HaMashiach has sown into my Spirit forevermore by the Spirit of Prophecy which has fallen fully on the Lord's Biblaridion:144 even at my Lord's command. Selah!</p>
<p>Therefore, hear these Words one and all and understand their authority and every Word will come to pass exactly as written, even by the eternal hand and power of YHVH the Great I AM, given in the beautiful and shining face of Christ Jesus whom I love and serve in all obedience, even whose Words I carry and announce as commanded, even these Words that are now released from the inner depths of my spirit by command of Christ Jesus who is also Yeshua HaMashiach and the times of the full activation of these seven thunders has come upon this judged and corrupted World so suddenly and unexpectedly now. Selah.</p>
<h3 class="h3otsikko" id="key2"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro2"></span>Key Declaration from Christ Jesus who is also Yeshua HaMashiach</h3>
<span class="spectral">Given July 6, 2025</span>
<p>Hear my Words and understand their authority and understand the power placed in my hands by Adonai-YHVH, O' slithering lying serpent, even the mighty and eternal hands of he whom you pierced, even that same Jesus the Nazarene, who gave myself mightily and willingly into your evil hands of disobedience, even in all love and obedience to Adonai-YHVH the Great I AM, because I am the Lamb of God, even that Son of Man who will utterly crush your head!</p>
<p>Behold! Hear one and hear all that I am, Yeshua HaMashiach, even Christ Jesus who has sent these Words by messenger and servant and by my messenger and servant have my Words been sent, even my servant whom I have raised from his youth, and sanctified in my spirit, and purified and cleansed in much chastisement and purification, and truly have I forged him in my fires of affliction because I am he who sits with billows in hand stoking the flames of purification and I am he who has made his feet as pillars of fire and I am he who has clothed him with a cloud and the rainbow upon his head, and I am he who has put his right foot upon the sea, and his left on the earth, and I am he who causes his face to shine as the Son because I am Lord of Lords and King of Kings and truly has YHVH made me a life giving spirit, Selah!</p>
<p>Truly, truly I am he, who has sewn and crafted the utterances of The Seven Thunders into my Little Book's spirit because he is my Biblaridion:144 into whom these seven thunders that govern that Little Book that I have opened in his hand, which is also that Everlasting Gospel, with which I have called and readied my 144,000, even by these Words that are tuned by my mighty hand to find the eyes, ears, and hearts of all those to whom they are sent, so hear my voice given in the Words of my messenger and servant that I had hidden in my quiver for such a time as this!</p>
<p>Except now, have I lit my arrows sent by my messenger whom I have armed and released from my quiver in full authority and my arrows ring true, because I am he who causes my Biblaridion:144 to cry with a loud voice, as when a lion roars: and as he has cried and seven thunders uttered their thunderous voices against you Heylel, and even all of your fallen ones whose judgment has come and is imminent and none of you can escape my mighty hand! Selah!</p>
<p>Hear my Words Heylel, for I call you by name you defeated and vanquished and slithering serpent and I see your fear because you fear your full judgment more than anything, even that same judgment that lingers not because my hand is on your neck, Heylel, and your times have come!</p>
<p>Selah, little prince, Selah.</p>
<p>And you, Heylel, you are powerless to conceal, nor alter my Words O' great deceiver, because they are released from the heart of my messenger who sees through your lies because he is tuned to the same message in Victory, given fully by the full Spirit of Prophecy and it is impossible for you to seal, conceal, nor distort the thunderous shocks of the voice of The Seven Thunders that resonate from the heaven of the heavens into the deepest chasms of the deepest abyss in all vengeance, and truly there is nowhere in YHVH's presence to the deepest outer edges of nothingness in his creation (For YHVH is even sovereign over that which is yet to be created) where their thunderous voices do not resonate in full authority in these times of fulfillment, and the times of fulfillment are now.</p>
<p>Selah, little prince, Selah.</p>
<p>Judgment falls.</p>
<h3 class="h3otsikko" id="key3"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro3"></span>Key Declaration from Adonai-YHVH</h3><span class="spectral">Given  July 6, 2025</span>
<p>Hear Hear, one and all the sound of my thunderous voice, even Jehovah-YHVH who is the same who has also saved the wild olive tree by the Works of Christ Jesus, even whose sacrifice have I accepted for all time!</p>
<p>Behold! The Lamb of God which takes away the sins of the world!</p>
<p>Behold! The Lion of The Tribe of Judah sent in righteousness to judge and make war!</p>
<p>Behold! My messenger who has been commissioned and sent and recovered and recreated by Christ Jesus and who is suddenly to be fully changed now at the sound of that mighty trumpet that is given in hand to sound so unexpectedly now, so rest in my Words my children and be at peace and Selah!!</p>
<p>And truly the world has beheld the Lamb of God and a mighty and great multitude has come to salvation by way of the wild olive tree and I have broken off the branches from the wild olive tree who accepted my peace treaty in faith and I have grafted them into the natural olive tree yet to be fully revealed, even the Israel of God, even that mighty Israel of God cleansed and purified by my mighty hand, even the hand of Christ Jesus who loved them and gave himself in sacrifice for the sins of Adam, Selah!</p>
<p>And truly, it is time for them to be gathered under the mighty hand of Christ Jesus at my command even so, because the very season of your redemption is upon you, O' mighty sons of Adonai-YHVH, even that same season that is about to unite in chronological unity with my seasonal kairos, triggered by my rhema and at the sound of that mighty trumpet given in hand now, to call and gather so suddenly even all whom I AM calling into my throne room and about to fully gather into the heaven of heavens at that exact and perfect time etched in my heart before the foundations of the World.</p>
<p>Behold! Your redemption has come, Children of Adonai-YHVH, even all those who have accepted Christ Jesus obediently as your Lord! And that trumpet is so surely about to sound so suddenly now even as promised in my holy writings! Are you listening my children for that shout and mighty trumpet blast given about to sound so unexpectedly now by your Lord and Savior, Christ Jesus?</p>
<p>Or are you listening to the voices of those who peep and mutter, and that Christ Jesus has not commissioned nor sent?</p>
<p>Selah.</p>
<p>Truly, the host of heaven stands at the ready because the command has been given and that last trumpet given in hand by my own hand to Christ Jesus himself who is also Yeshua HaMashiach and he it is who will give my command and my order at that exact perfect time (even which time is already casting its mighty shadow heavily upon my creation causing the fallen ones great fear) because Christ Jesus always does the will of his Father, even Adonai-YHVH: Selah!</p>
<p>Because. I AM the ancient of Days, even He who IS sovereign and even ancient even before days were made, and I AM HE who will eternally and forevermore remain sovereign when days on earth cease to exist, because chronology will eventually cease into an eternal and everlasting season of righteousness that has no end, and that is the hope of all the righteous that I have promised eternally and forevermore, Selah.</p>
<p>And truly, I AM he who will bring it to pass according to my eternal plans and purposes that I have worked after the council of my own will; and even though I AM surrounded by ten thousand times ten thousand of marvelous and perfect beings I have created by my own hand who excel in wisdom and righteousness, and are ever obedient in love to my voice. Because in my love for them I do care for them perfectly and I supply their every need even before there is a need, that I may glorify them and they may glorify me in their love and glorious brightness, for I have clothed them in eternally bright and perfect natures. Selah.</p>
<p>And I AM HE who does send these Words by my messenger and servant whom Christ Jesus has raised from his youth, and kept from great evil in the safety and strength of his mighty hand, and truly that wicked one has touched him not!</p>
<p>Because I AM HE who can literally accomplish all and everything instantly and effortlessly in my might! Yet, I AM also the same Everlasting God of Righteousness who is your creator, and as creator I create beings for my eternal plans and purposes to fulfill my everlasting and eternally righteous will.</p>
<p>Therefore, I AM HE who has created and prepared and commissioned and sent my messenger and servant who has faithfully returned to Yeshua HaMashiach in much chastisement, and repentance, and by his hand are these declarations sent from my throne, to Christ Jesus, into the heart of our mighty messenger and servant who has full judicial and declarative authority given by my hand by way of Christ Jesus even with the utterances of the seven thunders given directly into his heart by way of the Spirit of Prophecy for these Words are sown into his being by my command to be released by order of Yeshua HaMashiach even so that not a Word will be corrupted by the sins and disobedience of those who have abandoned their callings, whose judgments lingers not that will fall fully so suddenly now beginning at the house of God, that will happen so unexpectedly now, Selah!</p>
<p>So be it known, that these judgments are given to be read on this day, on the profane Gregorian calendar date of July 6, 2025.</p>
<p>And these Words will find the eyes ears and hearts of all those to whom they are sent, especially the disobedient and vile hearts of the fallen ones whose judgments have come. Even the fallen ones and weak and beggarly elements who follow them and have sworn themselves to follow Heylel. Even Heylel, the same who howled in defeat when he was hurled to the earth by my eternal hand in utter shame and defeat, even the same Heylel who was fully decimated and defeated by the Lamb of God who triumphantly declared as he hung in great victory on that rugged stake with those eternally reverberating Words of: IT IS FINISHED.</p>
<p>And so it is I, Adonai-YHVH, do declare that I AM he who sends these Words by way of Christ Jesus, even given and declared by that mighty messenger of Revelation Chapter 10 that I have sent at the command of Christ Jesus, even he who is described in Revelation Chapter 10 by that message that is sown into his heart given into him fully by the Spirit of Prophecy, and in his hand an open little book. Selah.</p>
<h3 class="h3otsikko" id="preamble"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro4"></span>Preamble</h3></p>
<p>These declarations are drawn entirely from the Seven Thunders and are issued on July 6, 2025, as commanded by Yeshua HaMashiach and YHVH himself.</p>
<p>These judgments are drawn from The Seven Thunders that are revealed in The Little Book of Revelation Chapter 10, which is also The Everlasting Gospel of Revelation chapter 14; revealed from March 2, 2024, to March 20, 2025. However, these judgments are drawn exclusively from The Seven Thunders, by which utterances Daniel's seventieth week will be fully governed,  revealed and unveiled fully, for there is nothing secret that shall not be made fully manifest.</p>
<p>These judgments are given by Yeshua HaMashiach and YHVH through the Spirit of Prophecy and these are their Words, that I do endorse and love eternally and forevermore. These declarations are judgments given to be read before full judgment fully falls, that will be given fully into the bosoms of the fallen ones eternally and forevermore because in their punishment they never have rest, nor peace, nor mercy: for rest, peace, and mercy they have not known, shown, nor given.</p>
<p>Be it known, that in this capacity, I function as a judicial agent and messenger sent from the throne of Yahweh himself, under authority of Christ Jesus, who is also Yeshua HaMashiach, whom I serve.</p>
<p>I am who and what the Lord has made me, and I am his Biblaridion:144, his little book, even the messenger described by the message that is bitter sweet and in my hand is an open little book Selah.</p>
<p>These judgments will start with the Satans, move to the Watchers, and finish under the umbrella of the fallen ones.</p>
<p>I do not come under my own authority or volition, and I have not self deployed, but I am sent with the Words the Lord has sown into my Spirit by his mighty hand to be released at his will and beckon call to be read and declared to both the Church, and also to Israel, but especially to this sin filled and judged and dying world and even more so to be given into the bosoms of the fallen ones for their times have come. Selah!</p>
<h2>The Voice of The Seven Thunders Speaks!</h2>
<p class="bgheading" id="thesatans"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro5"></span>The Satans:</p>
<h3 class="h3otsikko">From Yeshua HaMashiach: Thunder One!</h3>
<p>Satan has offered his so-called advanced knowledge from the beginning, even his knowledge of good and evil. He is a master manipulator and liar who has taught many things to mankind that Yahweh did not intend, for these are the ways of death. Yahweh's creation is not made to be manipulated for personal power and gain or as a means to escape God's judgment, nor to establish one's own ways and order. For Satan has corrupted mankind from the beginning, and he has corrupted the fallen watchers who joined their rebellion.</p>
<p>Oh, you great enemy of all righteousness, even you Satans: your initial sins were recorded by Enoch the scribe all this time ago, and they stand to this very day, for your sins were so recorded. And so I will summarize, for you have done these things, and much more have you done: You led astray all the sons of God, and brought them down to the earth, and led them astray through the daughters of men. You imparted to the holy sons of God evil counsel, and led them astray so that they defiled their bodies with the daughters of men. You showed the children of men all the blows of death, and led astray Eve, and showed the weapons of death to the sons of men: the shield and the coat of mail, and the sword for battle, and all the weapons of death to the children of men. And from your hand they have proceeded against those who dwell on the earth from that day and forevermore.</p>
<p>You Satans taught the children of men the bitter and the sweet, and you taught them all the secrets of their wisdom. You instructed mankind in writing with ink and paper, and thereby many sinned from eternity to eternity and until this day. For men were not created for such a purpose, to give confirmation to their good faith with pen and ink. For men were created exactly like the angels, to the intent that they should continue pure and righteous; and death, which destroys everything, could not have taken hold of them, but through this knowledge they are perishing, and through this power it is consuming men.</p>
<p>You Satans showed the children of men all the wicked smitings of spirits and demons, and the smitings of the embryo in the womb, that it may pass away, and the smitings of the soul, the bites of the serpent, and the smitings which befall through the noontide heat, the son of the serpent named Tabââ'ĕt. For you even requested Michael to show you the hidden name, that you might enunciate it in the oath, so that those might quake before that name and oath who revealed all that was in secret to the children of men.</p>
<p>For you caused the watchers to join your rebellion as you further corrupted mankind.</p>
<p>For you have persecuted and troubled the 12 tribes all across the earth as you sought their destruction. You have stolen children from mothers, and taken children from families and relocated them across the earth, and then lied to them and caused them to believe Jesuit fables regarding their true history, purposes, and origin. No matter, you have failed, because I, Yeshua HaMashiach, will fully reconnect them with their past, nation and true heritage, and I will make all who are heirs of salvation one new man, even in me, Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>By sleight of hand and great destruction, you have cleverly hidden away your technologies, even telling lies that the people of the past were ignorant and had no technology. For you showed the ancients your worthless mysteries, and there is nothing new under the sun. And so you hide the truth regarding your manipulations of the creation, even hiding them away from those you would seduce with your great deception. You have reintroduced your magic tricks yet once again, as you have set the stage so you can masquerade as aliens. And through your fake alien invasion you will cause all to wonder at your lying signs and wonders, even those whose names are not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world. But I, Yeshua HaMashiach, will expose you to the uttermost, and every hidden secret will come to light.</p>
<p>Behold! I will snatch away my faithful to the heavens, for I am coming for my Bride and I will not be stopped. And I, Yeshua HaMashiach, come to judge and make war and bring great judgment upon the earth, and you will not escape.</p>
<p>I, Yeshua HaMashiach, Lord of Lords and King of Kings, have sent these words by my servant, and by my servant have my words been sent, and all will be fulfilled.</p>
<h2>From Yahweh, the Great Eternal God: Thunder Two!</h2>
<p>Oh, you Satans, you have deceived my creation into following after your lying signs and wonders, and my wrath is hot on you. My people will be utterly separated from your tares that you have sown among my wheat in my garden of grace; and my Son, Christ Jesus, will gather my wheat in my barn, and so the Lord of harvest will gather, bind and burn your tares. Great judgment is upon you, and you will not escape my hand. From the beginning, you slithered and hid yourself among my children, even corrupting my little ones from the very beginning with your lies and deceit.</p>
<p>You are no gods, and those who followed your deception and delusions of victory are no gods either. You cannot create, for you lack the power, and I never created you with such abilities because I knew you would rebel before you were created; and in my justice and love I created you in righteousness, and you were perfect in the day you were created. In your worthless pride you boast of your own greatness, but you have no greatness, and I will fully expose you for the frauds you are. I will lay you in front of Kings, and they will see you and just how powerless you are. My son, Yeshua HaMashiach, utterly defeated you at Calvary, and you have no hope.</p>
<p>You are allowed to do only what I allow, as you are a defeated enemy. You stole the deed to the earth in your trickery and lies to Adam, and now my only begotten son, even Yeshua HaMashiach, has defeated you in his love for me and my creation; and the earth is his, even the Lord of Lords and King of Kings, for I have declared it. For he purchased the earth and mankind with his own sinless blood, and those who choose life will be redeemed. All your worthless works will be undone, and all who choose life will walk out of your lies and deception into newness of life, and I will make the faithful more glorious than you once were. For you have failed, oh weak and beggarly princes of the earth, even every prince in your order has failed along with you, oh slithering, lying serpent.</p>
<p>Now comes the time for your Judgment and your kingdom's utter destruction, even the kingdom you have built in your efforts to try and hide me, even Yahweh, from my creation. You will not escape. You will never again enter the heavens, for you are cast down to the earth never to return, and your place is in the heavens no more. You are bound to the earth that you lusted after, that was not yours to seize. Every one of your works will be undone in the lives of those you tried to destroy (and on the earth itself); they will forever dwell in peace and safety, and perfect happiness will they have, and I will dwell among mankind and I will be their God.</p>
<p>But you, oh slithering one, are powerless in my gaze, and you can do nothing to stop me. In the six days since the fall of man, for one day is a thousand years in my sight, you have accomplished nothing but your own judgment, damnation, destruction, and torment for you and all who follow. For you will be bound and cast into that great burning lake where I have made the hottest flames for you, even pure flames of blue, and you will forever burn, and I will recompense to you every evil work you have ever done, many times over. You have murdered multitudes upon multitudes, and you will pay for every soul that has been lost, and never will you escape. You will know all the sins you committed, and you will never escape from judgment, and you will forever be tormented for the sins you have committed. You will know full well your sins and offenses in your torment, and those you hate will have the final victory over you. And all the unrighteous ones whom you ever enticed to sin and commit themselves to join your rebellion, even those whose names were never written in the Book of Life, will share in your torment. You will all pay for every single sin you have committed, for you have sinned against Yahweh and against my creation, and I will repay. For in my justice I will recompense your own sins, actions, and evil ways fully back into your bosoms many times over and for all eternity. And I, Yahweh, even the great eternal God, swears these things by my own name, for I can swear by no greater.</p>
<p>You will serve my purposes, and in your hate and destruction you will drive my chosen to me; for I will lead them by the hand of Yeshua HaMashiach and his army of mighty men, for they will gather my remaining sheep. (Behold! The 144,000 sent by Yeshua HaMashiach will do mighty works in the face of your abominable evil.) And not one whom I have ordained to eternal life will fall to your schemes, for they can never be plucked from my hand, and neither can anyone pluck them from my Son's hands: For I have given him a name above every name, and he comes in the power of Yahweh himself, for I have shared my throne with him. And he will utterly crush your head. You have failed, little prince, and your time has come.</p>
<p>I, Yahweh, the great eternal God, have sent these words by my servant, and by my servant have my words been sent, and they shall come to pass. For Yahweh, the great eternal God, has so declared, and nothing can break my declarations. I AM El Shaddai!</p>
<h3 class="h3otsikko">From Yahweh, the Great Eternal God: Thunder Four!</h3>
<p>(to the watchers) You have joined the Satans, even the princes who arrayed themselves against me, and you chose the lies of the seraphim. Therefore, you will join them in the great eternal lake of fire, and you will forever burn, and never will you have rest. You have hurt my creation and killed so many, and you have no regard for the lives I have created. Therefore, I will have no regard for you, and I have created you, and now comes your judgment and eventual destruction.</p>
<p>I say to the Satans, the watchers, the fallen cherubim, the fallen seraphim, even all who have joined the Satans' rebellion: you will utterly burn, over and over again for all eternity; for I will bind you and cast you into the fire where your worm dies not, even the flames reserved for you worthless ones that will burn the hottest flames just for you, for you are worthy. For I will do to you exactly what you have done to others. All the pain, sadness, regret, suffering, even every detestable act will be recompensed to you for all time, and you will not escape. I will lay you bare before the nations and expose you for the frauds you are, and they will say to the little gods (who are no gods): Art thou also become weak as we? Are thou become like unto us?</p>
<h3 class="h3otsikko">From Yeshua HaMashiach: Thunder Seven!</h3>
<p>You fallen ones, even you princes of this fallen world, you Satans, you will all burn in unquenchable fire for your unholy hatred and your deeply evil ways of disobedience and destruction. As you did it to one of the least of these, my brothers, you did it to me.</p>
<p>You have followed the Satans who tried to destroy Yahweh's creation, even to the point of murdering me, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Hear my words, oh, ancient serpent, for your judgment is upon you and I see your fear, for you fear your future more than anything, oh, you worthless toothless lion! Vengeance is mine, and I will repay, and your times have come. The wrath of God and the wrath of the lamb are about to be unleashed as I will break the seven seals, as seven angels are sent to sound the trumpet judgments, and the seven angels are sent who have the seven last plagues, and they will be unleashed, for in them is filled up the wrath of God. Many woes will overtake you all, as I utterly punish and dismantle your kingdom. Your great king will I defeat and your false prophet will I defeat, and they will be cast alive into the lake of fire that burns with brimstone; and there they will wait for you to join them, and there will you ever be engulfed in fire and brimstone, and your judgment is about to begin!</p>
<p class="bgheading" id="watchers"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro6"></span>Watchers</p>
<h3 class="h3otsikko">From Yeshua HaMashiach: Thunder One!</h3>
<p>For Satan has corrupted mankind from the beginning, and he has corrupted the fallen watchers who joined their rebellion. For you caused the watchers to join your rebellion as you further corrupted mankind.</p>
<p>And so the sins of the watchers were so recorded by Enoch the scribe, and I will summarize as follows: They taught men to make swords, and knives, and shields, and breastplates, and made known to them the metals of the earth and the art of working them, and bracelets, and ornaments, and the use of antimony, and the beautifying of the eyelids, and all kinds of costly stones, and all coloring tinctures. They taught enchantments, and root-cuttings, the resolving of enchantments, astrology, the constellations, the knowledge of the clouds, the signs of the earth, the signs of the sun, and the course of the moon.</p>
<p>And so through your corruptions and lies, you have polluted Yahweh's creation with your evil ways and blasphemous abominations. You have led mankind astray and sinned against Yahweh, and you have wronged mankind, and even sinned against birds, and beasts, and reptiles, and fish, and your sins bring great judgment of which you will not recover. You have polluted Yahweh's creation with your technologies and manipulations, and you caused mankind to wonder after your tricks and falsehoods. For Yahweh only showed you the worthless mysteries of his creation and kept his most precious mysteries hidden in his heart away from your betrayal.</p>
<p>You evil ones taught your worthless ways to mankind as they multiplied on the face of the earth, and you brought great misery and destruction through your evil schemes and technologies. For you come not but to steal, kill, and destroy. You taught manipulation of the air, for you are the prince of the power of the air, for you manipulate the aithēr. For when Cain sinned, he built a city; and you have taught mankind your worthless secrets and manipulations. These cities were used for control and manipulation and to bring about mankind's destruction, as you used them to make your abominations of destruction.</p>
<p>By sleight of hand and great destruction, you have cleverly hidden away your technologies, even telling lies that the people of the past were ignorant and had no technology. For you showed the ancients your worthless mysteries, and there is nothing new under the sun. And so you hide the truth regarding your manipulations of the creation, even hiding them away from those you would seduce with your great deception. You have reintroduced your magic tricks yet once again, as you have set the stage so you can masquerade as aliens. And through your fake alien invasion you will cause all to wonder at your lying signs and wonders, even those whose names are not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world. But I, Yeshua HaMashiach, will expose you to the uttermost, and every hidden secret will come to light.</p>
<h3 class="h3otsikko">From Yahweh, the Great Eternal God: Thunder Four!</h3>
<p>Hear me and hear me well, for I declare what will become of you, even you worthless watchers who left your first estate. You have no peace, and though I have unleashed you from your bonds for a short season, I have only done so in order that you may serve my purposes. Then great judgment is on you, and you have no peace. For you caused me to flood the earth on account of your abominations. Who are you to play creator with Yahweh's creation? Who are you to desecrate the garden of God with your unclean ways? You made your bastards and reprobates by defiling yourselves with women, and they will share in your inheritance of fire. For what did I tell Malachi: For behold, the day comes that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble, and the day that comes, shall burn them up, says the Lord of Hosts, and shall leave them neither root nor branch. Behold that day surely approaches, and all of you will pay according to your own evil ways.</p>
<p>For I have given men wives that they may be lacking nothing, wives for companionship and to bear them children. But you descended on Mount Hermon, even leaving your first estate of glory, and you have defiled yourselves with women, and you have no peace nor rest. As I had Enoch the scribe tell you in the age of your offense: You have no peace: a severe sentence has gone forth against thee to put thee in bonds: And thou shalt not have toleration nor request granted to you, because of the unrighteousness which thou hast taught, and because of all the works of godlessness and unrighteousness and sin which thou hast shown to men. And in bonds you shall go as you are cast into the lake of fire.</p>
<p>You harmed my creation for your own lusts, even forcefully taking many you chose as your wives, and you will pay. You have joined the Satans, even the princes who arrayed themselves against me, and you chose the lies of the seraphim. Therefore, you will join them in the great eternal lake of fire, and you will forever burn, and never will you have rest. You have hurt my creation and killed so many, and you have no regard for the lives I have created. Therefore, I will have no regard for you, and I have created you, and now comes your judgment and eventual destruction.</p>
<p>I say to the Satans, the watchers, the fallen cherubim, the fallen seraphim, even all who have joined the Satans' rebellion: you will utterly burn, over and over again for all eternity; for I will bind you and cast you into the fire where your worm dies not, even the flames reserved for you worthless ones that will burn the hottest flames just for you, for you are worthy. For I will do to you exactly what you have done to others. All the pain, sadness, regret, suffering, even every detestable act will be recompensed to you for all time, and you will not escape. I will lay you bare before the nations and expose you for the frauds you are, and they will say to the little gods (who are no gods): Art thou also become weak as we? Are thou become like unto us?</p>
<h3 class="h3otsikko">From Yeshua HaMashiach: Thunder Seven!</h3>
<p>You fallen ones, even you princes of this fallen world, you Satans, you will all burn in unquenchable fire for your unholy hatred and your deeply evil ways of disobedience and destruction. As you did it to one of the least of these, my brothers, you did it to me. Oh, you fallen watchers, even you disobedient angels who left your first estate, you have no peace! You will be cast into the fire of which you will never depart, and you will utterly burn. All of your abominable unholy tares that you planted by crossing Yahweh's boundaries in your genetic manipulations between man and angel, between man and beast, between man and sea creatures, between beasts of various kinds, even every abominable thing that you have made will be cast into the fire with you, for you have no peace nor forgiveness!</p>
<p>You have followed the Satans who tried to destroy Yahweh's creation, even to the point of murdering me, Jesus Christ, when I willingly gave myself into his hands as the perfect Passover for the world, thereby sealing mankind's redemption and sealing your fate to eternity in the great fires that can never be quenched! You will utterly pay for all of your sins and abominations, and every evil deed you ever did will be turned on you a hundredfold, for all will be recompensed according to their works. And all your evil ways will be repaid on your own heads many times over, for you thought you could defeat me, and you arrogantly still think you can win when you are utterly defeated.</p>
<p class="bgheading" id="allfallen"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro7"></span>To All Fallen Ones</p>
<p>My called, chosen, and faithful, hear the Words of your living Lord and savior, even Yeshua the Messiah! The nations in which you live and the histories you have been taught by your Jesuit educators are the backdrop of the great deception, whose full revealing is imminent and already in motion, whereby the fallen ones will appear as benevolent aliens but in truth are malevolent fallen angels. What is it that has been? It is that that shall be: and what is it that has been done? That which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.</p>
<p>Hear me, oh, you fallen ones, even all of you who pierced me, for you said to yourselves, we have defeated Yahweh and killed his son whom he sent against us to subdue the earth, and we are victorious forever, for Yeshua is dead, and you foolishly rejoiced! You arrogant fools with no understanding! You didn't understand that God would raise me up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that I should be holden of it. You only bruised my heel, and you are powerless against me, and you understood not that the most high, even your creator, Yahweh, only showed you the worthless mysteries!</p>
<p>For he knew that you would turn on him and his creation and would try to take what he had prepared for me, the Lord Jesus Christ. My meek ones shall inherit the earth, for the earth is mine and the fullness thereof. For you have taught mankind forbidden knowledge; you taught war; you led women astray in beautifying of the eyelids with painted faces to fulfill your lusts on them; you corrupted the Garden of God by planting tares amongst the wheat, and every tare you planted for all time will be rooted out, bound, and cast into the fire with you! For you were defeated when I freely gave myself for the salvation of mankind, and God raised me from the dead to die no more!</p>
<p>But you were so unwise to not understand that I would give my life out of the love of God he created in me, for I am the savior of the world! Yahweh's love cannot be conquered, for Yahweh is unconquerable, and nowhere in creation is any being like him, for he is the most high, and his brightness and majesty is all powerful from eternity to eternity! For I told you, "this that thou doest do quickly!" You ignorantly and arrogantly did not understand that I allowed myself to be taken by your worthless hirelings who did the dirty deed of slaying the innocent blood! In your haughty ignorance, you failed to realize that I had twelve legions of angels at my command, for at any time I could have stopped you. But how else was the will of Yahweh to come to pass, except by my love and obedience to my Father? For Yahweh's love can no one overcome! No, not in heaven and not in earth, not in any way and not ever!</p>
<p>You fallen ones, even you princes of this fallen world, you Satans, you will all burn in unquenchable fire for your unholy hatred and your deeply evil ways of disobedience and destruction. As you did it to one of the least of these, my brothers, you did it to me. Oh, you fallen watchers, even you disobedient angels who left your first estate, you have no peace! You will be cast into the fire of which you will never depart, and you will utterly burn. All of your abominable unholy tares that you planted by crossing Yahweh's boundaries in your genetic manipulations between man and angel, between man and beast, between man and sea creatures, between beasts of various kinds, even every abominable thing that you have made will be cast into the fire with you, for you have no peace nor forgiveness!</p>
<p>My Bride, you are heirs of salvation in me, Jesus Christ. You have been called in me; you have been protected in me and by me; you have been given the chance to hear the preaching of faith regarding me so that you could make me your Lord, and therefore I have sealed you with that holy spirit of promise. Know that the seal cannot be broken, and you are about to be fully redeemed into eternity, for you have no idea of the fullness of the creative work that I am about to consummate in you, my Bride! Know that the fallen ones and their tares are jealous of you, and they hate whatever Yahweh loves, and I will avenge you fully on their heads, for I am the one who will wound that ancient serpent's head, for it has been declared, and what Yahweh declares cannot be changed.</p>
<p>And you, O' defeated prince, even you who stands in defeated silence for you are a toothless lion. Hear my Words O' you Satans and understand my speech, for I will not be denied my possession and you are powerless and toothless to stop me, therefore, I rebuke you Satan, even the Lord of Lords and King of Kings, for you are allowed to do only what is permitted under my mighty hand and authority, even given by Adonai-Yahweh himself, therefore, silence yourselves and sit in rebuke at my voice, for you are ever rebellious, and yet you are subdued, defeated, and the times of your judgment has come, and you will not escape! Selah, little prince, Selah.</p>
<div class="indent">
<p>Behold! I am Yeshua HaMashiach, even the same Lord of Lords and King of Kings, for I am Christ Jesus, even the Lion of The Tribe of Judah who sends these Words by my messenger and servant, and by my messenger and servant have my Words been sent, Selah!</p>
<p>I am Christ Jesus and I am he, who along with Yahweh, has revealed and sent these Words to our messenger and servant and by our messenger and servant have these words been revealed and sent. Truly, truly, these Words are part of The Everlasting Gospel that has been revealed in it's time, and the Words of The Everlasting Gospel will find the eyes, ears, and hearts of all to whom they are sent.</p>
<p>I AM, Yahweh, The Great I AM, and I AM he who has sent these Words by my mighty messenger and servant and by my mighty messenger and servant have my Words been sent.</p>
<p>And of an eternal truth, I AM he, along with Christ Jesus, The Everlasting King and Lord of Righteousness have revealed the Words of The Everlasting Gospel to our mighty messenger who was ordained from the foundations of the world for such a purpose and who has come to salvation from the gentiles in much chastisement and purification in the Israel of God and he will serve Christ Jesus as part of his mighty bride for all eternity as he moves into great glory to fulfill my eternal purposes in Christ Jesus in his assigned order, even rewards of glory reserved for the faithful that have not entered fully into the hearts of men at the time of this writing.</p>
</div>
<p>Therefore, understand the Words of The Everlasting God of Righteousness and my judgments that are set to fall. That now is the time of Jacobs trouble and the times of judgment are now set to fully fall, just as soon as the order is given to blow that beautiful last trumpet, and oh so sweet a sound it will make where my faithful children will hear my invite to come up hither! Selah.</p>
<p>It is I, Christ Jesus, The Everlasting Lord of Righteousness who has sent these Words by my mighty messenger and servant, and by my mighty messenger and servant have my Words been sent, even so that the faithful in Christ may be fully readied and waiting for the approach of their Bridegroom, who is now approaching for his bride! Selah.</p>
<div class="indent">
<p>I am Christ Jesus, and I have sent these Words by my messenger and servant and by my messenger and servant have these Words been sent, even so that my church, my body, and even my bride will stand fast in earnest and excited expectation of their full redemption that is about to break across the earth even as lightning comes out of the east and into the west and you will all be changed in the twinkling of an eye!</p>
<p>I am Christ Jesus and I am he who has sent these Words by my messenger and servant and by my messenger and servant have these Words been sent. Even as encouragement so my Church, my body, and even my Bride may be comforted with great comfort and that you may understand fully the exact nearness in time of this event, so that you are not overtaken in surprise of this event that is sure to happen so suddenly now.</p>
<p>I AM, and I have sent these Words of love to the condemned by my messenger and servant, and by my messenger and servant have I sent these Words to those who will shortly be judged.</p>
</div>
<p>And so this portion of Testimony of The Everlasting Gospel is now closed, and our mighty messenger has finished his course, faithfully as intended and will be taken into the heavens at the sound of that mighty trumpet that is to sound so suddenly now. The Words of The Everlasting Gospel will find the eyes, ears, and hearts to all they are intended and will fill the earth in their time, but will only be sent to heirs of salvation in judgment because The Mystery of God and my holy writings were neglected by the sins of men, therefore, a temporary dearth of scripture will fall on the earth in a famine of truth for those who have rejected my eternal truths, yet they will achieve salvation should they call on the name of Jesus to their end, having not loved their lives to the end!</p>
<p>The times have come and the times are now. Be ready.</p>
