<h1 id="ph">As it is Written, So Shall it Be Done!</h1>
<div id="prophecy">
<p>Gather yourselves and hear the words of your Lord, even Yeshua HaMashiach, my children, for I am Lord of Lords and King of Kings, and in righteousness will I come to judge and make war. So understand the times in which you live and events to come, and gather your ears to the sound of my voice, and hear the words of your everlasting and eternal Lord, even the resurrected and glorified Christ Jesus! I will now speak of things to come during Daniel's seventieth week and will make your paths plain, and I will extend my saving grace at the hands of my 144,000. For they do come to save my people from destruction, and they do come to hide away my people from wrath, even the wrath of God that is intended for the fallen ones and those who attach themselves forevermore to them and their kingdom by taking their mark, even that beastly serpent's bite of which there is no remedy.</p>
<p>And yet so it is that I will snatch my Bride into the heavens, and I will seal my 144,000 from the following tribes, even 12,000 from each of the following: Judah, Reuben, Gad, Asher, Nephthali, Manasses, Simeon, Levi, Issachar, Zabulon, Joseph, and Benjamin. So hear my voice!</p>
<p>And they will be an unstoppable force, even an unbreakable force will they be. For theirs are lives eternal, of which no corruption can corrupt. Theirs are bodies indestructible, for no destruction can take hold of the redeemed; for victory over death and destruction do they evermore have for all eternity. They will be re-created as children of light, and with everlasting glory will they be clothed, and they will have unique abilities and talents written into their very being that will reflect their accomplishments which comprise and embody abilities that I will create within them. For I, Christ Jesus, am the refiner who sits with billow in hand, stoking the flames of purification, that I may re-create you all newly in me, Christ Jesus your ascended Lord and Savior; and to whosoever overcomes, even they will inherit all things.</p>
<p>And so I give you to understand events that will shortly occur, and some events happen in succession while others happen simultaneously, and yet I will list them so you may discern the times you live, and so that you my tribulation saints are not taken prey to the strong delusion that has overshadowed the earth and of which many will be deceived and taken in judgment. For the fallen ones will show themselves and will lie many times over, and they will offer life but are powerless to offer life, and neither can they give life; but every word they speak is rooted in lies that lead to the second death, and only eternal destruction is to be found by those who follow the ways of the fallen ones and all who accept their sordid lies for truth. But so is the condemnation that has come into the world, that men love darkness rather than light and men love lies rather than the truth, because mankind has rejected me, Yeshua HaMashiach, even Jesus the Christ, in favor of a false savior; yet the truth is in Christ alone, and all else are liars and frauds.</p>
<p>And so things to come are as follows, and some events occur simultaneously and others occur in succession and are needed for further events to occur. And many events are not listed but will come about in their time. And so what some call rapture, or the gathering together of all in Christ to their Lord, is the first event set to trigger all other events during Jacob's trouble, also called Daniel's seventieth week, for a week of seven years will it be, where each day is a year. And so the faithful in my Church, which is my Body and my Bride, will be taken when I, Christ Jesus, descend from the heavens with a shout, and with the voice of the archangel and the trump of God. For the last trumpet will sound, at which time the dead in Christ will be raised to newness of life; then you which are alive and remain will be caught up in the clouds together with them, and it will happen even as it is written, and in the order given it will occur in the twinkling of an eye.</p>
<p>So understand, my faithful, even those whom I love with an eternal and everlasting love, that you will suddenly and instantly find yourselves in the throne room of Yahweh himself, where I will present you without spot or wrinkle or any such things to the Father of lights, and you are the lights of the world. And instantly will you know even as you are known, and you will see me, Yeshua HaMashiach, and you will see Yahweh, the Great Eternal God, with your own eyes for the first time, and you will be utterly astounded at what you see and the glory of which you will be clothed. And forevermore will you be in everlasting union with the Father, and with the Son, and forevermore will we be.</p>
<p>At the times of the gathering of the saints, the restrainer will be removed, and judgment will fall fully on the house of God. And those who have allowed me to refine them in the refiner's fire will stand because they have been purified in the blood of the lamb and will stand in the righteousness that I have given them, because I am the Righteous Lord who is a life-giving spirit. And those who refused my voice and remained stubborn to my will and refused to come out of sin into righteousness will be left to further refining during the times of Jacob's trouble, and many multitudes will achieve eternal salvation, reward, and splendor, and forever they will live and great glory will be theirs forevermore. And so also will the remaining counterfeit churches be destroyed as the Dragon, the beast from the sea, and the beast from the earth will move swiftly to make war on the remaining saints and will overcome them. And so will it be.</p>
<p>When the restrainer is removed, Secret Babylon will be destroyed as written. Even in one hour will her fate become final, and great misery and destruction will consume the earth, and great shaking will occur, and it will be plain to the world that the day of the Lord has come, though the fallen ones will lie and present themselves as benevolent aliens, and they will endeavor to cover my appearing for the faithful in war and a fake alien invasion. So do not believe their lies, my children, for their lies are intended to lead you to eternal destruction that is reserved for the fallen ones, so join them not.</p>
<p>And so the seals will be loosed and the four horseman will be released on the world, and many, many people will perish as a result. And of Secret Babylon's empire that sits on many waters, even these will be destroyed and culled, and the spoils will serve the rising and final beast system; and it is final because I, Christ Jesus, will utterly destroy and ruin Satan's kingdom, never to rise again. And so the world will wonder after the beast, and many will join their satanic kingdom. And the evil nature in mankind, brought about by Adam's sin when Eve took from the serpent and did eat, will be utterly unrestrained, and mankind will have full madness in their hearts, and many will forever join themselves to the beast by accepting and taking the mark of the beast. Take not his mark, because all who do will forever be cast alive into that fiery lake of brimstone, burning the hottest flames of blue.</p>
<p>Out of the ashes of war will their final empire rise, even from the ashes of the old order, because out of the chaos they cause will arise their new order, even the order of the Dragon. And so will they seek to unite all the world under their banner, and they will synthesize all world religions and will utterly deny me, Yeshua HaMashiach, even Jesus the Christ, who will not be allowed among them. And truly, truly, I have never had neither part nor lot with them. And so they will move with much speed and great cruelty in their war against the saints, and the world will turn completely on the tribulation saints, and all who overcome by calling on my name to the end will forevermore be glorified in eternal reward and everlasting splendor, and great is their reward, and those who overcome will inherit all things.</p>
<p>As their new society emerges, so too will my two olive trees arise, even my two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth. Great power will be given them, and they will prophesy for 42 months clothed in sackcloth; and if any man will hurt them, fire will proceed out of their mouth, and devour their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed. These will have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and will have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will. And great will be the world's hatred against them. And standing in opposition to my two olive trees will be the beast and the false prophet, and the one will point to the other, and they will glorify themselves, and many blasphemous things will they say, and many lying signs and wonders will they do in the sight of men.</p>
<p>These beasts will do great wonders to deceive them that dwell on the earth, for it will be permitted them to do many lying signs and wonders, and in like power will they rule. The beast from the earth will cause fire to come down on the earth in the sight of men, and he will lead all men to wonder after them with many lying signs and wonders. And he will make an image of the beast and will cause all to worship the image which he will make. And it will be permitted to him to give a spirit to the image of the beast so that the image of the beast should speak and will cause that all who will not worship the image of the beast should be killed. And he will make all, both rich and poor, free and slave, to receive his mark in their right hand or in their foreheads.</p>
<p class="spectral">IF ANY MAN WORSHIP THE BEAST AND HIS IMAGE, AND RECEIVE HIS MARK IN HIS FOREHEAD, OR IN HIS HAND, THE SAME SHALL DRINK OF THE WINE OF THE WRATH OF GOD, WHICH IS POURED OUT WITHOUT MIXTURE INTO THE CUP OF HIS INDIGNATION, AND HE SHALL BE TORMENTED WITH FIRE AND BRIMSTONE, IN THE PRESENCE OF THE HOLY ANGELS, AND IN THE PRESENCE OF THE LAMB: AND THE SMOKE OF THEIR TORMENT ASCENDS UP FOR EVER AND EVER. AND THEY HAVE NO REST DAY NOR NIGHT, WHO WORSHIP THE BEAST AND HIS IMAGE, AND WHOSOEVER RECEIVES THE MARK OF HIS NAME.</p>
<p>And during this time will their temple be built, even when animal sacrifice is no longer needed because I am the Lamb of God and I sacrificed myself for the sins of mankind as the high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. Atonement has been made for the sins of mankind once, all, and forevermore in my atoning, sinless, blood. And so it is, there remains no more sacrifice for sin.</p>
<p>And so when my two olive trees have finished their testimony at the end of 42 months, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit will make war against them and will kill my two candlesticks, for so it is given him to accomplish. And their bodies will lie dead for three and a half days in the streets, even as the world celebrates and exchanges gifts over their deaths. And so will a great voice come from the heavens and say, Come up hither! And to newness of life will they be raised, and they will be received into the heavens in the sight of their enemies.</p>
<p>And they will complete their temple and the trap will be set, for what fowler sets the snare in sight of the bird?  Because the beast from the earth is he who sets a trap in the land, he will lure many into his web of deceit, and he will betray the people of the land. And that man of sin will be disclosed, even the son of perdition, Which is an adversary, and will exalt himself against all that is called God, or that is worshipped: so that he does sit as God in the Temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. And their temple will be finished, and the abomination of desolation will be accomplished by their false Moshiach. And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the middle of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of the abominations; he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation determined shall be poured upon the desolate.</p>
<p>And so the greatest tribulation will occur, even a tribulation that the likes have never been experienced on earth before, and truly, never will be again. Behold! I, even Yeshuah HaMashiach, will not leave my people to sudden destruction, and I will yet save Israel, even that mighty remnant who will accept me as the true Messiah, for so Yahweh has created me to be. And so will my 144,000 come to the aid of those who would otherwise perish and who call on my name. I will lead them step by step, and my 144,000 will do many mighty works for me.</p>
<p>For these are those who are taken in the gathering of the saints to me, Christ Jesus, in the air at the sound of the last trumpet, and the trumpet is about to sound. These are my faithful, even those in whom was found no guile, for they have purified themselves as a chaste virgin in the blood of the Lamb, which I offered forevermore as their high priest, for I am forevermore the high priest after the order of Melchizedek. These are my Bride, and they will follow me wherever I go. Behold! I will make them powerful, and nothing has ever been seen on earth that can compare to the abilities with which I will clothe them. They will be clothed in fine, white, spotless linen, and their abilities will embody their accomplishments, and great abilities will they possess; for they are faithful, called, and chosen, even from before the foundations of the world by Yahweh for these purposes.</p>
<p>My 144,000 will descend on Mount Sion, and I will lead them. They will take those to whom I lead them into the wilderness to be hidden away from the utter darkness and persecution of the enemies' kingdom. They will be led to safety from the seven plagues, for in these judgments is the severity of the wrath of God to be poured out on the seat of the beast and to torment the kingdom of the Dragon, for great is their punishment. And the 144,000 will lead them to safety; they will heal them from their wounds; they will succor them and give them great hope to call on the name of the Lord, even to the end if need be. For had I not shortened the days, no flesh would be left alive. And so they will complete that in which I will lead them.</p>
<p>And as the unholy three moves to destroy those who accept me as their Messiah, so too will the full wrath of God be fulfilled on their heads and on their kingdom in its entirety; truly, truly, the seven vials of which are filled the wrath of God; and great judgment and misery are contained in their vials, and it will happen even as it is written:</p>
<div class="indent">
<p>The first angel will pour out his vial upon the earth, and those who receive their unholy mark will be stricken with noisome and grievous sores by the vial of which the first angel will pour.</p>
<p>And the second angel will pour out his vial, and the seas will become as the blood of a dead man, and all living sea creatures will perish.</p>
<p>And the third angel will pour out his vial, causing the rivers and streams to be turned to blood, for they have spilled the blood of the saints and the prophets, and so it is fitting that they be given blood to drink.</p>
<p>Truly truly, the fourth angel will pour out his vial on the sun, and it will be given unto him to torment men with heat of fire, and men will be scorched of the heat and will speak great and blasphemous things against the God of heaven.</p>
<p>And the fifth angel will pour out his vial upon the throne of the beast, and his kingdom will become increasingly dark, with great intensity, and they will gnaw their tongues for sorrow.</p>
<p>And the sixth angel will pour out his vial upon the great river Euphrates, and the water thereof will dry up, that the way of the Kings of the East should be prepared.</p>
<p>And the seventh angel will pour out his vial into the air: and there will come a loud voice out of the Temple of heaven from the throne, saying, It is done. And there will be voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and a great earthquake will occur, such as was not since men were upon the earth, even so mighty an earthquake. And the great city will be divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations will fall. And so will these things be.</p>
</div>
<p>So understand, my children, that Yahweh will hide away his own even during Jacob's trouble, even during the great tribulation will a remnant yet be saved alive and will remain in safety in the wilderness, even a place prepared of God himself, that they should feed them there a thousand two hundred and sixty days. And no flesh would be left alive had the days not been shortened. And the fallen ones will gather themselves to do battle with the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, and so it is written and so will it be done.</p>
<p>And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse, and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true, and in righteousness he does judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns, and he had a name written, that no man knew but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood, and his name is called, The word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And he has on his vesture, and on his thigh a name written, King Of Kings, And Lord Of Lords.</p>
<p>And so my angel will descend from the heavens, having the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain where he will bind Satan in the bottomless pit for a thousand years and set the seal so that he should deceive the nations no more for a thousand years. At the end of my thousand-year reign, Satan will be loosed from the abyss for a little season.</p>
<p>Behold! Even as John the Revelator did write, so even shall it be: And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshiped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection: on such the second death has no power, but they shall be Priests of God, and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.</p>
<p>And at the end of my thousand-year reign Satan will be loosed out of his prison for a little season to gather them together as the sand of the sea. And will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea. And they will go up on the breadth of the earth, and compass the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire will come down from God out of heaven, and devour them. And the devil that deceived them will be cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet will be, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.</p>
<p>And so will come the resurrection of the unjust, for so it is written by John the Revelator: And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the Book of Life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works. And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire.</p>
<p>And so it is written and so will it be done, that there is a gathering together where the dead in Christ will be raised and those who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds, and this will happen right before the start of Jacob's trouble. Then at the end of Jacob's trouble will the resurrection of the just occur, which is composed of the tribulation saints and those of the Old Testament who died in faith, having lived according to the promises. And as it is written to Daniel, so shall it be: But go your way till the end: for you shall rest, and stand in your lot at the end of the days. And so the end of the days is the culmination of Daniel's seventieth week and at the start of my thousand-year reign.</p>
<p>And at the end of my thousand-year reign and after Satan is cast to his final inheritance in that everburning lake of fire, so will the resurrection of the unjust occur, even that great white throne judgment will occur, and whosoever's name is not found written in the Book of Life will be cast into the lake of fire.</p>
<p>And so I, even Jesus the Nazarene, even the Lamb of God, even Christ Jesus, who is also the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, will come to judge and make war on the Dragon, and all his kingdom will be utterly smashed, never to rise again. And the beast and the false prophet will be cast alive into the lake of fire, and Satan will be chained with a great chain in the bottomless pit for a thousand years, and so my millennial reign will begin, and in righteousness will my rule be. Behold! I bring my Bride and a host of kings and priests with whom I will rule the earth in righteousness, and I will rule the nations with a rod of iron. So have great hope, my children, for the consummation of all things is at hand, and this seven-year period of great trouble, even Jacob's trouble, will be followed by my righteous rule, and Yahweh will be all in all.</p>
<p>And so I have given you great hope, my little ones, even so that you may fasten your minds on the joy that is set before you because the sufferings of Jacob's trouble do not compare nor are they worthy to be mentioned in relation to the eternal joy set before you. Behold! It is written by John the Revelator: These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore, are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his Temple: and he that sits on the Throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore, neither shall the sun burn them, nor any heat. For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. They shall be Priests of God, and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.</p>
<p>And so is your hope, my loves, that you may endure to the end, and yours is an eternal hope, because El Shaddai, the Almighty God, will create a new heaven and a new earth wherein dwells righteousness, and you will be given access to that holy city prepared and adorned by Yahweh himself as a bride prepared for the bridegroom, and from the tree of life you will eat. And as it is written: He that overcomes, shall inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.</p>
<div class="indent">
<p>Behold! I am Yeshua HaMashiach, and I have sent my words by my servant, and by my servant have my Words been sent.</p>
<p>Behold! The everlasting gospel has been revealed and sent in its proper time, and these words will be preserved, and they will find the eyes, ears, and hearts of all those to whom they are sent.</p>
<p>Behold! Keep your watch and do not leave your posts, my people, for the times have come.</p>
<p>Behold! The times are now!</p>
