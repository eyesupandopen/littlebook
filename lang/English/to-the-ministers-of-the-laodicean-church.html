<h1 id="ph">To the Ministers of the Laodicean Church: Hear my Words!</h1>
<div id="prophecy">
<p>My Bride and my Church, hear me in my love for you, my children, and incline your ears to my speech. Hear my Words, oh my Laodicean ministers, even you whom I have given gifts. For I have given gifts unto men, and I have given some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some pastors, and teachers. I have given these gifts to you for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ. For what did I tell my apostles and disciples in the writings of John's good news: And behold, I will send the promise of my father upon you. But tarry you in the city of Jerusalem, until you be endued with power from on high.</p>
<p>And in the Acts of my Apostles is recorded the fulfillment of this promise: And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the holy ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the spirit gave them utterance. And the founding of my Church is so recorded in scripture that you may know the fulfillment of this great promise of good news, that I have filled you with power from on high, even in the new birth, even in me, Christ Jesus your Lord. And I am the head of the body, the Church: I am the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things I might have the preeminence: For it pleased the Father that in ME should all fullness dwell.</p>
<p>My Laodicean ministers, my fullness does not dwell in your churches made in your own images, for I stand at the door and knock! My Laodicean ministers, I didn't hoard in selfishness all the fullness of the Father that is in me, but I poured out my spirit and made you powerful, and I have sealed you with that holy spirit of promise. Nothing can break that seal, though you can walk away into apostasy if you so choose. But the seal of the Father, even Yahweh the eternal God, cannot be broken; for it is impossible to break the seal of God, and you are sure in me if you are faithful in me, for my promises are yea and amen!</p>
<p>My Laodicean ministers, my gifts to you are neglected by your lukewarm ways, and you have quenched the spirit I have given you, and you refuse to open the gifts I have given you, and you let my gifts remain unopened in apathy and neglect. This is not a small matter to take lightly, for it is grave sin to your account, and you are disobedient to my voice. You don't respect my words, and you don't respect or teach my ways. For what did I have Paul pen to the young leader of my then newly planted Church, even Timotheus: Despise not the gift that is in you, which was given you through Prophesy, and with laying on of the hands of an elder. These things exercise, and give yourself to them, that it may be seen how you profit in all things.</p>
<p>Oh, that you had read my words with understanding! Oh, that you would remember my words in faith, but you don't comprehend and you are faithless! Oh, that you would obey my words, for obedience to me, the Lord Jesus Christ, is obedience to the wellspring of life, and out of your bellies will flow rivers of living water, for I have given you my spirit. But instead of reading my words, you stare at your screens in mindless disobedience; from screen to screen you go, entertained by sin! And you are so foolish to think that mindless disobedience is active faith in me, and you have been deceived. You have neglected the gifts I have given you, even the new man, and instead have spent time exercising your old-man nature in futility as you seek to satisfy your flesh.</p>
<p>Instead of exercising yourselves in spiritual matters, you in vanity exercise your bodies that are corrupted and perishing, for bodily exercise does profit for but a short season, and your bodies are perishing. For my voice echoes through time since Paul's letter to Ephesus: Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the Law of Commandments contained in Ordinances, for to make in himself, of twain, one new man, so making peace. Hear me, my children, for I love you and care for your souls, even my lukewarm Laodiceans. For you prefer to walk in your old man and his ways, even your corrupted flesh, for you show your flesh all preference. Instead, you should focus your minds and hearts on me and my every word: For man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God. For by open-faced obedience to my words (even the Word of God, for I am the Word made flesh and I dwell among you and in you), you walk in the spirit and not the flesh.</p>
<p>For I have told the Corinthian Church the following: But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the spirit of the Lord. My children, my epistles to my Church (even the love letters I sent to my Bride) are the mirror of your true selves, for your true selves are hid in the great mystery of God. By obedience to my words and precepts you will walk in the spirit, and you will give no satisfaction to your corrupted flesh. All scripture is to be respected and learned, but you are a mystery that was hid in God and is now unveiled, and you have to study what I revealed to Paul to understand the new creation I am making you in me, Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>My Laodicean ministers, there is utterly a fault among you. You have lost all respect for my words, and you neglect the gifts I have given you to the point you no longer even heal but turn my congregation over to pharmakeia and the scalpel; for if you were obedient to me, I would grant miracles to be done by your hands. But you respect the words of the apostate shepherds over the words of Yeshua HaMashiach, and my Laodicean congregation pays the price for your disobedience; for you no longer care for them, but instead you let them languish in powerless sin. Apostate shepherds are identified by the words I gave John in his first epistle: Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that Antichrist shall come, even now are there many Antichrists, whereby we know that it is the last time. They went out from us, but they were not of us: for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out that they might be made manifest, that they were not all of us.</p>
<p>Do you not understand that those controlled by antichrist spirits present another Jesus in place of the true shepherd, even me, Christ Jesus? For these are the enemies of the cross of Christ, and they are against me, and they set themselves in place of me, seeking to usurp my authority, which is impossible. These have infiltrated your churches, your seminaries, your various institutions, and they control your churches by your consent to operating a 501(c)(3), for all under such agreement are muzzled by worldly governments. Your 501(c)(3)'s show your greed for filthy lucre, for you have prostituted yourselves under the ways of Balaam, and you give false words for money so that you can keep for yourselves all the money my little ones gave you in your tax-exempt adultery! You have become a friend of the world, and the world is coming for anything attached to my name once the restrainer is removed. You lack spiritual discernment and you are blind! You lack the care to protect the flock from these ravenous wolves, for you value titles attached to your names, titles I did not give you; yet you covet them. For I have told you to covet earnestly the best gifts: And yet shew I unto you a more excellent way: a more excellent way which you refuse in your lazy, lukewarm ways.</p>
<p>You no longer preach sin and repentance from sin, but you preach happy-sounding fables that are not of me, and your fables are made up of lying words and lead to false ways; for you are nothing more than a storyteller who tickles the ears of the slothful. I am talking to you, my apostles: for your eyes are dark, and you no longer see my light, and you announce falsehood! I am talking to you my, prophets: for you speak for another Jesus, and you neglect my words, and you do not know me, and you prophesy of a false future! I am talking to you, my evangelists: For you evangelize the nations to false doctrines of devils, and you cause them to drink dirty water, for you fill them with unclean spirits! I am talking to you, my pastors: For you care for your own lusts, and you have made your own belly your god with your self-help philosophical trash; you fool, you cannot heal my sheep with a lying tongue! I am talking to you, my teachers: For you no longer teach the pure words of my gospel, but you teach words of ecumenical compromise, and there is utterly a fault among you all, my Laodicean ministers. You have all the same malady in common: You no longer respect the precepts in my Word, and you no longer respect the individual words in my scripture.</p>
<p>You arrogantly think that you are translators because you can cherry-pick meaning from secular lexicons and secular concordances to suit your ends: Books I did not author, for I author scripture through my prophets, for the spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus! Translators who speak only one language, and you have become a laughing stock! Instead, you respect the words of the apostate shepherds, even the worthless tare pretenders. They infiltrated your congregations so they could pretend to be you (for you are the wheat I would gather into my barn if you yet turn to me). But instead they are tares, false brethren who became false ministers who lead you astray. A counterfeit and poisonous plant they are!</p>
<p>These evil ones no longer go out from among my Church that they might be made manifest, but you invite them in and constrain them to sup with you and honor their false words and lying tongues over the words I would give you, even the words of the Living God, even the words of Yahweh! You merchandise my words so you may have all the glory and acclaim that belongs to me, your Lord Jesus Christ. Verily you have your reward, and I will strip your reward and give it to someone who was faithful in your stead. For you won't even speak for me any longer, and I have to come to my Church as the voice of one crying in the wilderness, for you have shut the door in my face, though I still stand and knock! Utter shame and contempt is on you unless you repent!</p>
<p>Should you ignore my words and not hear my voice, if you continue in your lukewarm ways, I will leave you to Jacob's trouble; for I said before to you, my Laodiceans, I will spew you out of my mouth unless you repent! And again I stated in regard to that false prophetess Jezebel when I wrote Thyatira, for what did I tell John the Revelator?</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, I have a few things against you, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calls herself a Prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols. And I gave her space to repent of her fornication, and she repented not. Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her, into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.</p>
<p>Have you not read these words? Are you arrogant enough to think that either Yahweh or Yeshua HaMashiach are respecters of persons? Do you think I respect the titles you give yourselves to hang over my people's heads, as you lord yourselves over God's heritage?</p>
<p>Reverend this, Bishop that; had you not neglected my gifts, your gift would have made room for you before great men and you wouldn't need your worthless titles, for I would have honored you and you would have honored me, but you dishonor me! There is utterly a fault among you, and my anger is kindled against you, for you have failed the commissions I have given you and instead have become apostate, even leading my little ones into the ditch where you have pitched your tents. You prefer the unclean waters in your ditch over my pure waters of holy spirit of which all who drink will never thirst again!</p>
<p>You offer unclean, filthy water to my little ones in broken cisterns, and my anger is on you! I will strip your reward from you and give it to another, for as I have said regarding you: Verily, you have your reward. You have your reward of your preferred seats of self honor, and you have your reward of useless titles, and you have your reward of filthy lucre, and you will have the reward of my anger unless you repent and return to me in humility. For the reward of my anger is wrath, and when you present me your wood, hay, and stubble, it will burn to ashes in front of all, and you will be found false ministers!</p>
<p>There is utterly a fault amongst all of you, even you, my apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers! You no longer hold yourselves in saving relationship with me, Jesus Christ, but you have let go of me; for I am the head of the body, and you are to hold me above all else! You CANNOT minister for me if you don't even know the sound of my voice. You are deaf, and you have permanent ear damage unless you repent, for I will heal your ears from the spirits of slumber so you can hear my voice, for I am speaking to you! Unless you hold me as your head and respect my Words, I will leave you blind and in the ditch with those who led you. You are blind, and you have permanent eye damage unless you repent, for I would heal your eyes from the spirits of slumber so you could read my words and see my face: but yet a little slumber, yet a little folding of the hands.</p>
<p>You have become a laughingstock and a disgrace, for your lukewarm ways profane my holy name. Not only do you not hold me, Christ Jesus, as your head (for if you did, you could speak for me), but you go further into apostasy by profaning my holy words, for I am the Word made flesh! I ask you, have you not read my warnings? For I testify unto every man who hears the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add to him the plagues that are written in this book. And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the Book of Life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book. Are you so foolish, deaf, and blind that you do not understand that I gave that warning not just for the great book of my revealing, Revelation! But that warning applies to all the holy writings! For my Proverbs cry aloud in the streets for all who have ears to hear: All the words of God are pure and clean; for he is a shield unto all them that put their trust in him. Put thou nothing therefore unto his words, lest he reprove you and thou be found a liar.</p>
<p>My Laodicean ministers, who have befriended the world. My Laodicean ministers, who lord themselves over God's heritage, giving out that you are some great ones. My Laodicean ministers, who have neglected my spirit I have created in you. My Laodicean ministers, who give yourself worthless titles and handles to attach to your names. My Laodicean ministers: Hear my words and answer me, for every tongue will confess!</p>
<p>Who authorized you to change my words, even the Word of the Lord that I have given through my messengers? Your ways, oh you slothful Laodicean ministers, are nothing new, for as soon as my letters were circulated to my newborn Churches recorded in Acts and elsewhere, gnostic sects led by gnostic false prophets changed my words and rewrote scripture, for they went out from among my Church that all may know that they were apostate shepherds!</p>
<p>You will reap the rewards of their ways, for you have joined yourselves to them, and you live their ways, and you manifest unclean spirits of Jezebel, the false prophetess that you call holy! I see your evil works, and they are recorded in the heavens in perfect detail against you! You are to speak the words I give you, and you are to speak them honestly, with integrity, without changing so much as a word of any prophecy! I am not speaking against myself, for I have told you: Study to shew yourselves approved unto God, a workman that needs not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth justly. Many words have been changed in my writings over the years, and if you will study and respect my words I have given, I will lead you into all truth, for so I have given the comforter.</p>
<p>I will show you, if you will listen to the many voices I have left for you. Follow the texts I gave in Antioch, for they are the voices of many witnesses, and my witnesses do not lie and nor do they disagree. Look to the Textus Receptus and stay clear of apostate Bibles: study to understand! But you, my Laodicean ministers, you do not respect my words, and you change my words to suit your own sordid ends, lecturing my people so that they continue in sin, even leading them deeper into your filthy ways! There is utterly a fault among you, and you do not follow my ways, for you are arrogant and hard-hearted, and I will leave you to destruction of the flesh unless you repent and change your ways. For I, Jesus Christ, have sent these words! Only neglect them not, and repent in sackcloth and ashes. Repent publicly to your congregations and confess your sins to those you led astray, for I will take your candlestick from you. Repent and walk uprightly, and I will return your candle with a newly lighted flame, for it is I who will kindle the fire of my spirit in your soul.</p>
<p>Return to your first love, for you do love me, just not according to knowledge. Balk not at my words, for I am coming sooner than you think, for I come as a thief in the night. Even in your error, you think that a thief in the night is someone who sneaks in a window like a criminal. You fool! Oh, that you understood the ways of the Hebrews. The thief in the night was the high priest who came unannounced to see that his priests were faithful in their temple duties, for some duties went overnight until those duties were finished according to law. Should the high priest find a priest under his watch sleeping on duty, he would toss a hot coal into his garments, so the priest would shake off his flaming garments and run out of the temple naked and ashamed. Don't be asleep when I come, or you will slump before me naked and ashamed in the worst shame imaginable, for I will be ashamed of you and strip you of all reward. My chastisement is on you and my hand is heavy against you, and unless you repent, you will have great, great trouble that you could have escaped. Repent, that I may still set a place for you at my table, and you will join my Bride in marriage to me, Christ Jesus, the Bridegroom.</p>
<div class="indent">
<p>I am the Word made flesh who dwells among you.</p>
<p>I am the good shepherd and my sheep hear my voice.</p>
<p>I am the Lamb of God sent for the sins of the world.</p>
<p>I am the high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.</p>
<p>I am coming and my reward is with me.</p>
<p>I am he that walks among the seven lampstands and the seven angels.</p>
<p>I am the prophet raised up from among the brethren of whom Moses spoke: Hear my voice in obedience.</p>
<p>I am he who has given gifts to men, so neglect not the gifts I have given.</p>
<p>I am coming sooner than you think; prepare yourselves, my Bride!</p>
</div>
<p>I, the Lord Jesus Christ, have sent these words and have become the voice of one crying in the wilderness; for my Laodicean Church is lukewarm and will soon be naked and ashamed unless they repent. I stand at the door and knock just a short moment longer! No more numbers are on the clock, for the numbers have fallen; and no more grains of sand are to be found once the final grain flows through the hourglass, and it is about to drop.</p>
