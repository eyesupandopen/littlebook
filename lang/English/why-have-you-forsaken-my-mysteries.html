<h1 id="ph">Why Have You Forsaken My Mysteries?</h1>
<div id="prophecy">
<p>Why have you forsaken my mysteries, oh, lukewarm Laodicean church? Why have you forsaken the great mystery of God? You have exchanged the most sacred secrets of the Father, even Christ in you the hope of glory, for filthy lucre, and your God has become your belly. Yet, you will say to me, "There is no fault in me. I am not chasing filthy lucre, for I am upright before you." And I retort: Do you not chase after the fake prosperity gospel taught in your Laodicean churches? You have sold the truth of God's most sacred mysteries for base gain, and you no longer have the hope of glory that I passionately want you to understand, but you have changed the hope of glory into the hope of material gain that you seek to gather for yourselves by your impure thoughts. I did not call you to money and materialism, but to righteousness and true holiness that is found in me.</p>
<p>Turn from your errors and buy eye salve of me, that you may anoint your eyes to see the truths in Scripture I have given you for your own salvation. You have been duped into supporting world governments, thinking that by supporting them you are supporting God's chosen. You should feel shame before me because in your ignorance you do not understand who the true Israel of God is, and you no longer understand the great mystery of God that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ, by the Gospel. For I am your peace, who has made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between you.</p>
<p>You have allowed your identity to be stolen by the synagogue of Satan, and you have lost yourselves in the words of false prophets. Do you not understand that you are the Israel of God? As many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. Oh, lukewarm church, who will save you from your adulterous fornication that has corrupted you from the single mindedness that is in me, Christ Jesus your Lord? You cannot hang on to this dying world, thinking that in so doing you serve me; and you should repent of your support of evil world governments, for what concord has Christ with Belial, and they do not serve me but Satan. Go to my Scripture and seek your true self that I have hidden in my epistles; for you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. And he that is dead is freed from sin, and the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death.</p>
<p>Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away, behold, all things are become new. I have created you in me as a newborn, taking your first breath in eternity; for eternity started for you the second you were born again of my spirit, for I have made of two one new man, so making peace. Yes, one new man in me composed of Judean and Gentile alike in my church of God. Those I have called to newness of life in me are God's chosen people, and those born of my spirit are the true sons of God, and if any man has not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</p>
<p>Why do you disallow sections of Scripture, counting them unholy because of your so-called positive thinking? Why do you divide Scripture, thinking that the entire Word of God is not for your doctrine, practice, and learning? Fake positive thinking at the expense of the truth blinds you to my ways and my purposes that I have preordained for you. Yes, you should set your thoughts on things above, but do not call sections of my Scripture doom and gloom because you do not consider it positive thinking. You are trapped in Christian witchcraft, practicing the very knowledge of the fallen angels who taught mankind sorcery and witchcraft and root cuttings to begin with.</p>
<p>Your fallen-angel knowledge is a cunningly crafted lie designed to snare your soul by good words and fair speeches. Know that many evil men over the years have introduced occultism into Christianity, telling you that if you think something long enough, it has to happen as you think. You fool! God did not create you to build your own delusion around your self-help Christianity and happy thoughts. You follow another Jesus and have left the faith that is in me, and you have deserted my words and precepts in favor of good words and fair speeches, and you have been corralled by greedy wolves who lie to you.</p>
<p>They lie to you and misapply the law of Moses, telling Christians they should tithe to support their organizations that are not built on me, the chief cornerstone. Check Scripture, and understand that as a man purposes in his heart, so let him give and give cheerfully, for God loves a cheerful giver. And this is a key precept in the New Testament ratified in my blood. The tithe was to support the Levitical priests, and they supported the high priest with the heave offering. This is done away in me, for I am the high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek and have made you priests and kings before me. But you, oh, lukewarm church, you are blinded with visions of false power and abilities, abilities not found in Christ.</p>
<p>You control nothing by your thoughts alone, and you are blind to me and my purposes that I have prepared for you. You have stopped your ears from hearing sound doctrine in favor of false doctrines that tickle your ears. Not only that, but you attack the brethren who have become your enemy because they tell you the truth in these matters, and you have rejected the Berean mindset in favor of emotionalism miscalled Christianity. Understand this, wayward shepherds: you will be recompensed in judgment for leading my sheep astray, and vengeance is mine and I will repay.</p>
<p>Understand this, my children: you control nothing by your positive thinking, and you are not a prosperity magnet on account of your happy thoughts. You are deceived and have been led astray by many deceivers. Furthermore, you can do nothing without me just as I can do nothing without my Father; for it is God who empowers the righteous and the Father who has created all, and each to glorify Yahweh's righteous name above all!</p>
<p>Come out of your greed and forsake the love of money, for the love of money is the root of all evil.</p>
<p>When you close your eyes to my entire gospel and selectively pick and choose what you consider "positive," you are in the ditch with blind leaders who led you both to that end. I did not call you to fall in a ditch my children, but I called you to live before me in righteousness and true holiness, so rise up out of the mire. I called you to forsake your sins and repent of your unrighteous ways. Only by my atoning blood can you be purged from your sins; your positive thoughts do not work righteousness, though you have made them the idols of your heart.</p>
<p>Why do you allow false brethren and Judaizers into your midst to spy out the liberty you have in me, the righteous Lord? Had you understood the great mystery of God, you would understand that Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness to every one that believes, For Moses describes the righteousness which is of the Law, that the man which does those things shall live by them. For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law. What of the Mosaic law, then?</p>
<p>I have fulfilled the requirements of the law and justified man by faith in me, for I have overcome, and I have fulfilled the law, giving myself as the perfect Passover once and for all; therefore, the just shall live by faith. Have you not read that I did not come to destroy the law or the prophets but to fulfill the law and give righteousness to men by their identification with me, their Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>This I say then, walk in the spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh, and there is no law against the fruit of the spirit. Therefore, you are buried with me by baptism into my death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father: even so you also should walk in newness of life. Only in my atoning works, as the sinless lamb of God, can anyone overcome sin and be freed from the curse of the law; for I have been made a curse for you, for cursed is any man who hangs on a tree.</p>
<p>Moses described the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which does those things shall live by them. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation. Christ is the end of the law for everyone that believes, yet so many of you will reject these very words because you revere the words of your pastors, preachers, and rabbis more than the words of your Lord and Savior, Christ Jesus. Do you not understand that you are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone? For no other foundation can any man lay, then that is laid, which is Jesus Christ; therefore, you are not under law but grace.</p>
<p>For those who believe can enter into my rest, for he that is entered into my rest has also ceased from his own works, as God did from his on the seventh day. Know you not that the law was your schoolmaster to bring you to me, Christ Jesus? Yet many have rejected me and my grace and my mercy in favor of their own pointless works of righteousness. Blindness in part has come to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles comes to consummation. Oh, wild olive branch, boast not yourself against the olive tree you are grafted into, and do not follow their blindness; for I am able to save Jacob and I will do just that as a remnant shall be saved.</p>
<p>Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of any holy day, or of the new moon, or of the Sabbath days. Why do you place a burden on my children, telling them they must pronounce my name in some sacred language? I understand all languages and look on the heart, so I know when my children call on my name in whatever language they call, and I seal them with my Father's seal accordingly, and I bring them into the Church of God. Neither the fathers nor you are able to keep the law, but the law is fulfilled in you in my righteousness; for the law comes down to two great commandments: Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, and love your neighbor as yourself.</p>
<p>Righteousness does not come by the law but by faith in me, the Lord Jesus Christ. For I am the high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek, and by my atoning blood you are justified, for I am the perfect Passover, and I am the lamb of God. Let no man lead you astray in these matters. The Law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient. Behold! I have blotted out the handwriting of ordinances, that was against you, which was contrary to you, and took it out of the way, nailing it to my cross. Yet, you still desire to be in bondage to the weak and beggarly elements. What saith Scripture: Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for we are not children of the bondwoman but the free.</p>
<p>Have I not plainly stated: Behold! I show you a mystery, we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, for I will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and the trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first, then you which are alive and remain will be caught up in the clouds to meet your me, Christ Jesus in the air, and so shall you ever be with me. Oh, Laodicean church, you reject even my plainest words to you. Therefore, know that I will reject you from my table, when I greatly desire to set a place for you in the heavens.</p>
<p>You think it but a light thing to reject my words and lead others astray in your error. Therefore, since you want the day of the Lord, I will leave you to endure the day of the Lord, seeing you arrogantly think you can stand. You reject my appearing and magnify the words of false prophets over sound doctrine that I have given in me. Have you not read the parable of the ten virgins? I counsel you to have faith in my words and deny me not, so I won't have to deny you. Which will you be, my children? Will you be amongst the wise virgins who prepared themselves with trimmed wicks and oil in your lamps? Or will you take your place with the unwise virgins, saying, Lord, Lord open to us; and I will say to them, I know you not!</p>
<p>Have you not read? For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the Church. Do you not understand the words of the bridegroom, my bride? You are to hold to me as your head in the same manner that a wife holds to her husband as her head, for the Bride is my Church and my body, and what man ever hated his own flesh? Yet, you allow the wayward shepherds to lead you astray in this matter, and many of you esteem twisted words from twisted false prophets over my Holy Word.</p>
<p>You have placed your faith in wicked men, men I have not sent; yet they deceive you with good words and fair speeches that I have not given them. You follow them as if you are following me. Repent! Many of you are following false ministers who appear as ministers of righteousness. No marvel, though, for Satan transforms himself into an angel of light, so it should be no surprise that his ministers do the same. Many of you are blinded by false light, from false ministers that I have not sent, and they speak great swelling words that are contrary to the sound doctrine in me, the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Take a stand for yourselves, oh, spineless Christians, and come out of her and depart from Mystery Babylon. I would that you were hot or cold and not lukewarm, and I have no desire to spew you out of my mouth. Therefore, return to me, my children, and return to my words. Hold me as your head, for I am the Lord who died for you, and you resurrected when I did. Why do you rely on false prophets? You need not that any man should teach you, but the anointing you have received of me abides in you and teaches you all things, oh, ye of little faith! Turn to me and return to the narrow path. Weep, howl, and repent, my children! As many as I love, I rebuke, that your calling and election may be sure.</p>
<p>Know that I love you dearly and desire your full heart over your works. Come to me with an open heart and give me your all, as I have given my all for you. Fear not and do not condemn yourselves, for there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus. Just return to me and confess your sins, and I will forgive you and restore you to the purposes and gifts I have given you. Stand strong and steadfast, for I will very soon appear suddenly, and the world will know that I have snatched you away, as this thing will not be done in secret. Time is short, my children, and very soon time will be no more.</p>
