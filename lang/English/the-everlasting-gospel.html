<h1 id="ph">The Everlasting Gospel!</h1>
<div id="prophecy"> 
<p>Hear the Words of Yeshua HaMashiach and bow your ears in obedience. And so the seasons change and the day is here when calamity will fall suddenly on the earth. Suddenly will I gather my faithful to me in the clouds and suddenly will destruction fall across the earth and suddenly will the world you know be forever altered, never to return to this corrupted and sinful state. Though an end of Satan's sinful rule is in sight, that day will not fully come until all power, and authority of the Dragon is put down at my second coming when I will come to rule the earth in righteousness with the warriors in heaven, even the great armies of heaven amongst whom will be the first-fruits from the dead and I will gather them to myself.</p>
<p>For those who will be with me are called, and chosen, and faithful and true. And they have proven themselves faithful in a few things, so I will make them ruler over much and they do enter into the joy of their Lord. They will be an indestructible and eternal army that in no way can be conquered nor stopped, and they will literally tread underfoot all aspects of the enemies Kingdom in utter destruction and subjection of all things evil. For vengeance is mine, saith the Lord, and I will repay. And I, Yeshua HaMashiach, am Lord of Lords and King of Kings, and in righteousness I do come to judge and make war.</p>
<p>So hear my words and understand the hope of all creation, for even the creation waits in earnest expectation for the manifestation of the Sons of God! For the creation was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope: Because the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God. And so I, Jesus Christ, will deliver the creation in righteousness and I will heal the earth and in righteousness will I rule. And I will put down all authority and rule of the enemy, and Satans kingdom will never again rise.</p>
<p>As it is written, so shall it be, and so I had John the Revelator write: And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse, and he that sat upon him is called faithful and true, and in righteousness he does judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns, and he had a name written, that no man knew but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood, and his name is called, The word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it, he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treads the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And he has on his vesture, and on his thigh a name written, King Of Kings, And Lord Of Lords. And so is the hope of my second coming, and that day draws ever closer with each passing second.</p>
<p>Behold! On that day I will bring my warriors for so is their inheritance, even an army like no other, for an army such as mine has never been, an unconquerable army composed of the redeemed, even those who were born dead in trespasses and sins but now will live life eternal and who cannot be killed nor conquered. For I am empowered by Yahweh for such a purpose, and I will have empowered and rewarded them for their faithfulness and love for me and my name, even Jesus the Christ! For whoso loves and serves Yeshuah HaMashiach also loves and serves Yahweh, for there is no higher than the great everlasting God of Israel! On that approaching day you will see the heavens opened, and you will see me, Jesus Christ, lead out from the heavens that great and mighty heavenly host, and it will be an army like no other, ever! For my Bride will be with me.</p>
<p>And I will utterly crush the beast and the false prophet and all their armies and all their abominations that they have abominably made and so will they be destroyed even by the brightness of my coming and by that sharp double-edged sword proceeding from my mouth, and they shall not stand but will be utterly destroyed. And the beast and the false prophet will be cast alive into that burning lake of fire and brimstone and never will they be released from their torment, for they have made themselves worthy. But first the earth must be cleansed through Jacob's trouble and many will come to me, even many multitudes and every soul who calls on the name of the Lord to the end shall be saved to the uttermost, and Israel must be gathered for I will yet save a remnant from Jacob who will yet come to their true and everlasting Messiah, for I am Yeshua HaMashiach and I do come according as the promises to the Father's have been declared of old by Yahweh himself, and I am their fulfillment and my time has come.</p>
<p>So for those who have rejected my saving name, even Jesus the Nazarene, I counsel you to hear my words and understand the times you live and run to the sound of my voice and call on my name right now and confess me as your Lord, because you have no time to waste. Just as there were those who were firstborn into the new birth at the birth of my church on the day of Pentecost as recorded in scripture, so too will there be the last to come to the new birth in this age of grace, even all who come to salvation as my outpouring of holy spirit in my age of grace and mercy comes to a close.</p>
<p>And so a dearth of all things godly will now fall on the earth and sin will now be unrestrained as I remove my restrainer when I gather my Church. Natural man has rejected my voice, natural man has rejected my grace, natural man has rejected my mercy, natural man has rejected my invitation to righteousness, and natural man has rejected me Jesus the Nazarene and therefore natural man has rejected Yahweh the great eternal God who sent me, and now I will give the world the darkness they so desire.</p>
<p>But understand that many will do mighty works for me, and my two witnesses, even my two candlesticks will prophecy, and I will send my 144,000 to rescue many, so fear not! Salvation will be accomplished, even through the destruction of the flesh and great multitudes will come to salvation during this time. For of a truth, Yahweh has never and will never leave himself without witness!</p>
<p>The times of the Gentiles have born much fruit amongst those who would otherwise remain hopeless unless they were included into the promises made to the Fathers, even those who live by the faith of the Son of God who loved them and gave himself for their salvation. For as it is written: The just shall live by faith! And so by faith in me, Christ Jesus, they have become children of faith, even children of the faith of Abraham. For Abraham believed God before the seal of circumcision was given, and it was accounted to him for righteousness, even as Moses testifies! And so Abraham is the father of all who believe and those who have become justified by faith in Jesus Christ the Righteous, for I am the just and justifier of all who believe on my mighty name!</p>
<p>Yet so many have used my grace and mercy as a license to sin, even relishing and boasting of their sinful and destructive ways, even teaching their children to live their sinful ways and so the generations are evil in their ways and their ways are detestable and so evil men and seducers have become worse and worse. Be not deceived, if a man sows to the flesh that man will of the flesh reap corruption. And all who reject my offer of eternal life and instead choose the corruption of Adam will reap the fruit of that same corruption in eternal judgment, for judgment is here and the times of revealing have arrived.</p>
<p>Truly, truly, the times of great judgment prophesied of old by Enoch the scribe (for his testimony was given for this generation), are come upon the earth even as it is written and all will give an account. Those who have accepted my offer of salvation and who are found faithful in Christ at my appearing will be forever changed, whether they have fallen asleep in Christ or whether they are alive and remain in Christ, those in Christ at my appearing will be taken into the heaven of heavens. To be in Christ is to walk by my mighty spirit, even the law of the spirit of life! And those who lived righteously before the birth of my Church and for the tribulation saints is the resurrection of the just, where the righteous will rise to newness of life in great, everlasting and eternal reward. At the end of my 1000 year reign there will be the great white throne judgment and all those who lived and reveled in unrighteousness and sin will be recompensed according to their works and many will fall to the second death for so have they chosen.</p>
<p>And so the times of revealing have come, and the everlasting gospel has been revealed in its time even the little book in the hand of my mighty angel is now revealed and the utterance of the seven thunders have been declared! For this work is an everlasting work, and is the culmination of covenants and promises of old into the covenants and promises of the new, even my New Testament that I have ratified in my own blood. For I Yeshua HaMashiach, even Jesus Christ the Righteous who is King of Kings and Lord of Lords, am he who is given for the fulfillment of all promises and all covenants.</p>
<p>For John the Revelator wrote what he saw, and so he wrote: And I saw another mighty Angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire. And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth. And again John the Revelator announced: And I saw another Angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel, to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, fear God, and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</p>
<p>And so it is written and so it is done. The everlasting gospel has come to be revealed in its time and the little book is no longer a mystery. The mighty angel who is clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire. The rainbow is the sign given at the Noahic covenant that Yahweh made with Noah after the deluge that he would never again flood the entire earth. A cloud and pillars of fire represent God's covenant with Moses, built further on previous covenants. For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people and so was the Old Testament ratified!</p>
<p>And as it is written in Hebrews: For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh: How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.</p>
<p>And so as it is written so has it been accomplished my faithful, and so is the New Testament. And even as it is El Shaddai that commanded the light to shine out of darkness in the beginning, in like manner the Almighty God has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ. So it is, in my new covenant which is of stronger force, since I ratified it with my sinless blood, is fulfilled all covenants of all time, for I stated at calvary in my dying breath: It is finished. And so the new covenant was ratified by my blood into the New Testament!</p>
<p>And so in me, Christ Jesus, are the covenants of old fulfilled with open face glory, even in the face of your everlasting savior and Messiah, even me Yeshuah HaMashiach. And this angel John the Revelator describes had one foot on the sea and one foot on the earth for my salvation is open to both those from the sea of nations, (the Gentiles) and those from the land of promise even all who have made me their everlasting Lord, even as many as the Lord our God shall call! And so my everlasting gospel will find the eyes, ears, and hearts of all to whom it is sent and many will come to salvation for every word of God is living and eternal and not one word of Yahweh will in anywise fail nor pass until all be fulfilled. For with Yahweh all promises are yea and amen and all will be fulfilled and I, Christ Jesus, gave myself in agonizing torment to seal my new covenant in my own sinless blood, once and for all and into everlasting eternity will the new testament live.</p>
<p>So hear my words and understand my speech, even the voice of your Lord and Messiah. The times have come my children and my words have saturated the earth and my prophets and ministers have covered the ends of the earth, and in all languages, and tongues, and nations has my gospel of salvation been heard, even to the ends of the earth. And so it is, and so I declare: My good news is built always on the foundation of the law and prophets and I am the chief cornerstone of which the entire temple of the living God rests! My children, you are the temple of the living God!</p>
<p>And so I give you to understand there are many components to the gospel of Christ! Are you foolish enough to believe there are only four gospels? And there are also many other things which I did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. And so it is there is the good news of my first coming, there is the good news of the mystery of God that I revealed to Paul the Apostle, there is the everlasting gospel that leads us to the culmination of all things. With Yahweh there is never an end of good news! </p>
<p>And so I ask you a question? Are you Yahweh's counselor? Are your lying theologians and lukewarm ministers able to counsel Yahweh? Who are you, oh man, to determine when and how Yahweh speaks and the content and nature of his Words, or to whom he chooses to send his words? And so it is. The Words of God will continue to flow and all testimonies will be completed and books will be written into eternity for the Word of God lives and abides forever!</p>
<p>And so I ask you, did the New Testament of Christ Jesus erase the Old Testament and Old covenants? God forbid! Every Word God is pure and all will be fulfilled even once, all, and forevermore! And so is the nature of the unchanging God! Around his throne are ten thousand times ten thousand yet he needs no counselor. Yahweh, the great eternal God works all things after the counsel of his own will and he is the everlasting God! Yet he has revealed his plans, even his eternal and everlasting will in increments. Why would Yahweh do such a thing you may ask? Have you not read what Paul the Apostle recorded when I had him write? But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God had determined before the world, unto our glory. Which none of the princes of this world have known: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</p>
<p>And so the eternal God, even Yahweh who needs no counselor and in his everlasting wisdom reveals his ways and Words in the manner he chooses in the fulfillment of his everlasting plans of redemption for mankind. Understand my loves, even my Bride, that you have been in Yahweh's heart since before creation and you have been cleverly hid in the Father's heart and it has been hidden from you what you will become at my appearing, for you are dead and your life is hid in me Christ Jesus. And when I appear, so shall you appear with me in glory! My little ones you are about to be recreated fully in me and you will be astounded at what Yahweh has prepared for those that love him. For as it is no man on earth has fully understood exactly what the sons of God will become at their full redemption, and you are about to find out for the day is here and my appearing is at hand.</p>
<p>I counsel one and I counsel all, even Christ Jesus your eternal Lord! Receive my Words and gain wisdom and understanding, for your true selves are an eternal mystery hid in God himself that is about to be fully revealed. You will very soon find yourself standing in the very throne room of Yahweh, even our Father, and he eagerly awaits and longs for your presence right now, even from eternities past. And the great halls in heaven are prepared for your arrival and the tables are set and the wedding of the Bridegroom to his Bride is at hand and my bride has made herself ready and I will receive them to myself and forevermore will they ever be with me in everlasting covenant and they will do many mighty works of which has not entered into the hearts of men at this time.</p>
<p>And so Yahweh the great eternal and everlasting God has readied and prepared many things for you, and I, Christ Jesus the elevated and ascended Lord have your reward in my hand even for my faithful. And the host of heaven eagerly await your presence and into heavenly and everlasting reward you will now go. So fear not because your lives are now to be revealed and at any second now the last trumpet will sound, are you ready for my appearing my little ones? For it is nearer than you imagine and time between then and now is inconsequential and serves the everlasting purposes of Yahweh the great eternal God!</p>
<p>Do you not know? or have you not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord has created the ends of the earth? he neither faints, nor is weary and there is no searching of his understanding.</p>
