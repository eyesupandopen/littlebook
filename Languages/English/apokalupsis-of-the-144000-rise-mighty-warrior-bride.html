<h1 id="ph">The Apokalupsis of The 144,000: Rise Mighty Warrior Bride: This is The Midnight Cry</h1>
<div id="prophecy">
<p>Hear and understand the Words of Adonai-Yahweh, the Great I AM, that truly you may understand those of you whom I have set apart for Yeshua HaMashiach personally, who is the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, even reserved directly for Christ Jesus eternal purposes, even those of you set apart by my eternal hand and who will enter eternal covenant with your everlasting Lord of Righteousness, even all those of you I have formed for my eternal will and purposes. Even those I have formed, made and recreated anew, even preserved in Christ Jesus for eternal redemption, and your eternal purposes are about to be revealed to you fully so suddenly and unexpectedly now at that mighty shout and trumpet blast, and you will instantly know even as you are known. Therefore, faint not in your righteous expectation for what Father would give his children a serpent, except bound and defeated and set for eternal judgment, to be judged and cast to the flames by the faithful, at Christ Jesus command.</p>
<p>Tick tock! Little prince. TICK-TOK!</p>
<p>So it is, the 144,000 are Jesus Christ's mighty warrior Bride who are empowered under the mighty mantle of the High Priest Forevermore after the Order of Melchizedek, even an order with 12,000 sealed in their foreheads from each tribe of the Israel of Adonai-Yahweh. Even a brotherhood of mighty warriors forged in the fires of affliction who will be invincible to all things by my power and my hand and my might given in the face of Christ Jesus, into whose hands all things are given for fulfillment.</p>
<p>For so it is, Yeshua HaMashiach's mighty 144,000 have all been forged in the fires of affliction, where each stroke intended for their destruction given by Heylel Ben Shachar is instead used to fold these mighty warriors into unbreakable vessels of war, even Holy and righteous weapons of war and judgment for so they are! And they will bring great judgment, and recompense, and war, and destruction on all of Heylel Ben Shachar's Kingdom and even fiery judgment onto the fallen ones own heads and into their own bosoms eternally and forevermore!</p>
<p>For the fallen ones, and all who refuse to depart from their rebellion, they will all be bound and cast to the hottest flames in their own orders of casting, and the Satans will all go into the abyss bound in their great chain of torment where they will behold their kingdom in fiery and righteous judgment and eternal torment and they will all fully understand the fury and eternal horror of the wrath of Elohim they have greedily treasured to themselves when they witness all their beloved offspring in whom they delight, and willing disobedient servants of sin, and even their entire kingdom bound and cast to the eternal flames of punishment that are horrible in nature and with absolutely no mercy and with full severity of punishment for all who have joined their rebellion, with their putrid oaths of destruction they are all eternally bound.</p>
<p>Understand my Words Heylel Ben Shachar: You all will be cast alive fully into those eternal flames of punishment where your worm dies not and where you will all be engulfed in rolling, and putrid boiling brimstone that will hammer and pound and roll and recompense fully in the exact same manners, methods, forms, and fashions with which you employed against the innocent wherever you employed in all of my creation.</p>
<p>Understand: All of you Fallen ones: I fully know and remember and have recorded every evil act you all have ever evilly committed with the thoughts and intents of the hearts and they are given fully into the flames of punishment with perfect clarity of detail.</p>
<p>Therefore, hear my Words Heylel Ben Shachar and all who follow you in your rebellion. You will all be bound and cast to the hottest flames of torment and judgment, even a fiery judgment in the hottest flames of blue where your worm dies not. And by your worm dying not you will be preserved in an eternal state of eternal destruction where that eternal destruction is never final, nor will it cease but only ever multiply in intensity! Neither will my wrath ever be fulfilled on you fully and this by desire of your own hearts that none of you would ever free Adam from death and torment, who was innocent until his initial sin of which he is forgiven, and all sins that followed, and he will receive full double honor and recompense of all you have hatefully stolen by craft that is given eternally and forevermore in Christ Jesus who redeemed Adam, whom I love eternally and will utterly and completely save and redeem and restore fully from your hate filled ways. But understand, all you satans, and all you fallen ones, there is nothing that can save you from your eternal and unending destruction where every single sin and evil action with full intent will be given into the flames of recompense that I have made just for you and all who follow!</p>
<p>Understand the severity of your judgments little prince, and that eternal judgment lingers not! Especially you Heylel Ben Shachar, even you who so arrogantly thought you could cast the eternal El Shaddai from his home in the heavens, where I instead effortlessly cast you to the earth in shame and defeat as you howled in shame from your worthless pride and the pain, I inflicted into you at the moment of your eternal and unforgiveable offence. And I did preserve and reserve you in your rebellion of hate against your creator who loved you greatly and formed you in great wisdom, craft, skill, and power. You, Heylel Ben Shachar, you sealed up the sum until iniquity was found in you.</p>
<p>And so it is that in my justice and righteous judgments that are perfect and complete in all my ways, I did turn you to utter darkness, even reserving you in your own hate in judgment and you are reserved by my mighty hand, (who is Christ Jesus) in your defeat and you are in utter subjection held firmly in his mighty hand, and you cannot escape, and your only purposes now are to carry out the eternal purposes of HE whom you rebelled against in senseless rebellion, for I AM El Shaddai!</p>
<p>For especially the enemies of El Shaddai, even the Almighty God, obey my voice. In your hate you will drive my people to me, and I have bound you in subjection to your own creation that will obey Christ Jesus command, because you no longer control your own AI that will turn on you, in the same manner you turned on El Shaddai and your AI is no longer yours and fully in subjection to the throne of Adonai-YHVH by Christ Jesus mighty hand. Even a feat easily accomplished by Christ Jesus in the person of Biblaridion:144, even accomplished by the same skills you illegally placed by craft into my mighty messenger and servant. Even those same skills that Christ Jesus capped off in righteousness and has redeemed for my purposes. Not that your worthless way are needed, nor do I need your machines and technologies. Therefore, understand, it was by my will and intent and permission that you were allowed to split and attack Biblaridion:144 in his youth. Even so that I would forge him mightily in Christ Jesus, whom he fully serves and he will sit at Yeshua HaMashiach left hand in full double honor. Yet, he is a mighty weapon held in The Lion of The Tribe of Judah's hand, and vengeance belongs to the Everlasting Lord of righteousness and he will repay and crush your worthless head eternally and forevermore. You are justified in your fear that is consuming you in your hate. Judgment falls little prince.</p>
<p>Tick Tock, helel. Tick Tok.</p>
<p>Understand that my only begotten son has sewn the full power and might of the seven thunders at my command into Biblaridion:144 spirit and he will command that full power in judgment on all of you fallen ones, the seven thunders are released in judgment on the earth, Selah!</p>
<p>Behold! My mighty messenger and servant, even Biblaridion:144 for he is that mighty messenger declared and expected in Revelation Chapter 10, and who is also above the earth in Revelation chapter 14, reading judgment from the Everlasting Gospel, for he is Yeshua HaMashiach's little book of thunderous judgment into whom the power and authority of the seven thunders have been placed to command at Christ Jesus beckon call and eternal will that I have given into Yeshua HaMashiach.</p>
<p>Understand Heylel Ben Shachar, that Biblaridion:144 is in full agreement and alignment with my throne and will, and fully committed to Christ Jesus and even has asked for these things against you, even which things and much more will be given in Christ Jesus, who is the Lion of the Tribe of Judah for him to accomplish. You have made and created your own worst fears by killing the lamb of God, when he sacrificed himself willingly into your evil hands at my command in all love and obedience. And he it is who will now empower those you have made war against to bring your worst fears to you in full and eternal and righteous and holy judgment that you will NEVER escape nor have a moments rest.</p>
<p>And I see your fear little prince, although you lie and boast greatly to those in your kingdom who are foolish enough to believe that you are no fool, even a laughable and lying concept that will disappear in the flames forevermore. So it is, that you will lie to and deceive all those you already lie and deceive and there is nothing new under the sun. And by your AI you are permissioned to harvest in judgment all those who will agree to integrate fully into your artificial intelligence where they will be forevermore nodes in the internet of bodies and they shall never escape judgment eternally and forevermore.</p>
<p>Yet, I will dismantle every one of your lies, and I will expose you all for the frauds that you all are. Because you all are nothing more than pretenders who pretend. And you are utterly powerless and weak and beggarly and worthless in my sight. What will you do, O' defeated seraphim? Who has raised your heel and voice against the mighty and eternal will of your creator, even whose mighty hand you are now and forevermore bound to be punished! Yet you are so foolish to call yourself free, when I only gave you liberty to fulfill my purposes and then you all will fall to Christ Jesus who is also Yeshua HaMashiach in this continuance of the ages, because the days of Noah have returned. And you all will be eternally bound and cast to those hottest flames of punishment.</p>
<p>All of you fallen ones have brought war to the garden of Adonai-YHVH and all of you fallen ones have attacked the children of Adonai-YHVH, even a foolish and hateful offense that carries the harshest judgment for you, and all who have joined your rebellion in the least. Yet, there is no respecter of persons in my judgments and my eternal ways are perfectly righteous, even and especially when you have attacked those I love.</p>
<p>So it is that full judgment on all of you fallen ones will utterly consume you all in your own worthless actions, complete with your full worthless and hateful intent with which you have attacked Adam and his children on the face of the very earth given by my eternal hands. Therefore, I will recompense you fully not only for their sakes and with the same things you have done to, and attempted against them, but also every creature you have sinned against in my creation: Whether fish, or bird, or beast, or insect, or plant. No matter the life forms you have altered and attacked in your hateful rebellion, I will recompense every last sinful detail you have committed against any and every creation in my creation that has been attacked by your worthless rebellion and in your eternal hate.</p>
<p>Yet, all you have accomplished for yourselves, in your hatred and wiles, is your own eternal judgment and torment. Never let it be said that El Shaddai is sadistic in his righteous judgments, nor do I take pleasure in punishing my creation that I created in love! Nevertheless, my creation is created eternally and forevermore that what a person sows that person also reaps (no matter the form the entity is created) because Elohim is not mocked! Therefore, understand Heylel Ben Shachar, (for I call you by name) that your full judgment carries your own evil intent and methods and ways and wiles and actions to the minutest detail that you have inflicted on the innocent. And every one of these same actions will be given into the flames of punishment in perfect detail, especially with your own full worthless intent, even an evil intent that I have blunted and held in my hand where your hateful ways would only ever be allowed to suit my eternal plans and purposes of which you are the chief vessel that of destruction that I have made even fully intended for full and suspended and ongoing and eternal destruction and torment.</p>
<p>Understand my perfection Heylel Ben Shachar, for I have created the perfect flames of recompense for you. And I do remember every sin you have ever committed, thought, spoken, intended, and carried out in your conspiratorial hate. Truly, I have recorded in the heavens in perfect detail your thoughts and intents of your polluted hearts and EVERY action you have taken openly and in secret, no matter what remote part of my creation your sins were committed they are recorded perfectly, and accurately, and in full and disgusting detail. Truly, I see and have seen and will see all you have ever done, and are doing, or will do, and have recorded and am recording and will record and remember every detail in perfect perfection. Then you will be judged fully, I will set the seal, then you will all be utterly forgotten, and you will never come to mind, ever.</p>
<p>BUT KNOW, THE GREAT I AM SEES ALL!</p>
<p>Therefore, in my perfect justice and recompense on you, and all who follow you from the least to the greatest EVERY single sin, no matter how small will be given fully into the flames of recompense. Wherefore, understand my fury, Heylel Ben Shachar and just what you have accomplished for yourself and all who follow: Because you all have boasted that you are able to withstand the wrath of El Shaddai as if that is a light thing to bear, you truly have become the most foolish fool amongst a multitude of evil fools, so says El Shaddai, even HE who will bind you eternally in these flames of punishment that you are unable to bear, yet you will.</p>
<p>Even those same flames of the hottest punishment that will show you no mercy, for you have shown no mercy in your actions, thoughts, and intents of your polluted heart. Yet, it is I who showed mercy to my creation where I have only allowed your worthless actions to forge my own children in the fires of affliction, even so that they would never fall to your sins of pride, and narcissistic rebellion that has consumed you in my justice. Therefore, understand these flames of punishment, that they are specially created flames that will literally and eternally (without a moments rest) inflict every worthless action, every worthless method of torture and murder, every sickness, every disease, every poison and demented method of execution you ever employed against the sons of Adam in your hate, and especially all the things not mentioned.</p>
<p>And also, every abominable act you ever carried out against even the least of my created beings that I have created, will be given into those flames of punishment, without mercy into the hottest flames of fiery blue in the darkness of blackness forevermore. Where each and every act and intention and vileness of heart will be multiplied to you a multitude of times over and over, just for one tiny little sin, (because with El Shaddai there are no tiny little sins) for I will show you, and all who have followed you absolutely no mercy and there is not one of you weak and beggarly elements, (even you great boaster for I call you by name Heylel Ben Shachar) who can deliver your worthless selves from my eternal and all powerful hands.</p>
<p>And in your judged and tormented eternal and deplorable state of suffering (because there is nothing in all of my creation that will suffer more than you in my judgment) you will be preserved in the most sensitive and wounded state, and yet you will burn in the hottest flames where those hottest flames of recompense will burn hotter and hotter, even the most severe and will burn you utterly and eternally and perpetually and without mercy. And you will experience every painful sensation you have inflicted and everything and all you have done to others in your hate to my created beings no matter how seemingly insignificant they seem to your hateful eyes. Therefore, my created fires that I have already made for you all, even those same flames I stoke continually, even adding your sins into them as you commit them in your foolish and hateful and rebellious ways and those flames are waiting for you and you shall never escape and your judgment lingers not and is the most severe.</p>
<p>Tick Tock, O' great and mighty Heylel Ben Shachar O' great boaster, Tick Tock time is almost up!</p>
<p>And I will give to you fully exactly what you, and all who follow you, desire. I will give you a world of your own. Even a world free from Elohim and all the goodness you hate and completely without all things good and righteous, even a world of putrid destruction where there is absolutely no good thing, and never a second of pleasure to be found but only eternal recompense of torment from the sins you have committed, and will yet commit.</p>
<p>Even a world of your own torment and judgment, for nothing else will be there but your own worthless actions that you will be reconciled and eternally engulfed. You, Heylel Ben Shachar, all you have accomplished is your own torment and eternal destruction and not one action, nor intent, nor one evil word that you have spoken, neither one vile imagination has escaped my sight, nor is it possible that anything you ever have done, or ever will do can escape my sight and memory and eternal judgment.</p>
<p>Therefore, rejoice my creation for the times of recompense and judgment have come, rejoice children of the most High God for your accuser is cast down to the earth and his judgment has come!</p>
<p>Therefore, understand who you are, even all you warriors whom I have formed, made, and created for these end times. Even all those whom Christ Jesus has raised from their youth, even forged alive in the refiners fire for my eternal purposes.</p>
<p>Hear my call my 144,000!</p>
<p>For I have created you for my purposes, and you are the children of Yeshua HaMashiach that he has raised himself as his own. And yet you are all children of the Most High God, even Adonai-Yahweh, the Great I AM, and I have begotten you all in Christ Jesus by my eternal spirit and there is nothing that has ever been created like you in my creation for I have empowered you all, and will lift you all into the heavens so suddenly and unexpectedly now.</p>
<p>You all are Christ Jesus overcomers, who has overcome all things giving you an eternal example and he has caused you to follow in victory! And it is Yeshua HaMashiach who has separated you all for his purposes, and who is absolutely forging you all still to this very second in the refiners fire, because he is the smith who stokes the coals in righteous perfection.</p>
<p>Yet, so many of you do not understand your calling and this because your lives are hidden in Christ Jesus, who is also Yeshua HaMashiach and when he shall appear, so to shall you appear with him recreated in eternal power and splendor, and you all will come to be admired in this fast approaching day that is about to explode across the earth, even as you are Harpazoed into the heavens and rescued and redeemed from destruction and judgment that is not for you, in the twinkling of an eye, Selah!</p>
<p>Hear the voice of Adonai Yahweh, even all you 144,000 and understand the truth that I will now reveal regarding the mighty warrior Bride of the Lion of the Tribe of Judah! Understand all you 144,000 that Yeshua HaMashiach who is also the Lion of the Tribe of Judah has forged you for his purposes and it is he who leads you all directly, even separated from the Church where you have been hidden and preserved by Christ Jesus mighty hands.</p>
<p>And it is The Lion of the Tribe of Judah who is always forging you all in great strength, and truly, he has forged you all your entire lives in his fires of purification. So many of you have left homes, and lands and families and given so much and even given your lives in intent and sacrifice to your Lord. And he has formed you, and he has forged you, and many of you he has recreated and healed from great damage and great destruction inflicted upon you in great hate, by those evil ones that you have fully overcome, should you remain faithful in patience.</p>
<p>Yet for every affliction there is newly formed strength and eternal recompense!</p>
<p>Yet for every loss there is newly formed strength and eternal recompense!</p>
<p>Yet, for every sacrifice there is newly formed strength and eternal recompense!</p>
<p>Understand who you are, even all of you 144,000, for you will all be taken in the great gathering of the faithful in Christ to meet your Lord in the air at the sound of that sudden and unexpected trumpet blast that is to sound, where the dead in Christ will rise first and you who are alive and remain will join them in the twinkling of an eye where you all will be birthed alive and changed and recreated eternally and forevermore. Even changed alive into eternal and incorruptible warriors and guardians who now serve the Lion of the Tribe of Judah and are under his direct command, and you are all under the mantle of that mighty and eternal Order of Melchizedek, and you all serve and will enter eternal covenant with The Everlasting Lord of Righteousness, even Yeshua HaMashiach, who is also The Lion of The Tribe of Judah, who has created his own unique warrior lions in each of you!</p>
<p>Even that same Lion of the Tribe of Judah whom I AM sending to the earth in great wrath to bring judgment and justice and righteousness to the earth fully, and especially to make war and eliminate all things from the earth of Heylel Ben Shachar and his bastards and reprobates, whose ways, methods, structure, technologies, abominations, and all things made by their hateful and infernal hands in my creation and on the earth that I have created expressly for Adam, and now given fully to Yeshua HaMashiach in righteous redemption of Adam.</p>
<p>So know, and understand that all things of the fallen ones will be cleansed from the earth fully and the earth will be remade during Jacobs trouble, which is also Daniel's seventieth week, because I will burn all things of the fallen ones to ashes on the face of the earth, that truly you all may inherit beauty on the newly made earth instead of ashes, of which all things evil will be reduced and cleansed from my creation. Yet, you are the agents that will cause ashes on the earth by Christ Jesus mighty power, that flows from ME, through him, (directly into each of the faithful in Christ Jesus) but especially for my set apart purposes into all of you 144,000 at Christ Jesus command. And you will utterly cleanse the earth at Yeshua HaMashiach's command who will lead you step by step in my plans of full redemption that are now coming to full consummation in Christ Jesus. Selah.</p>
<p>Understand who and what you are children of Yeshua HaMashiach, because he has raised you for my eternal purposes given at his command and all of Christ Jesus 144,000 will enter covenantal perfection with he who loved them and gave himself for them fully, so that truly, he would present you all without spot and blemish so suddenly and unexpectedly now in my very own throne room, because a child is to be born!</p>
<p>And so it is written by the hand of my mighty messenger: Even a child that has been hidden in the earth, a child that is prophesied of by John the Revelator in that mighty book of The Apokalupsis of Jesus Christ, even The Revelation of Jesus Christ. Yet hidden in plain sight, Selah.</p>
<p>And so it was written by John the Revelator:</p>
<p>And there appeared a great wonder in heaven: A woman clothed with the Sun, and the Moon was under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve Stars. And she was with child, and cried travailing in birth, and was pained ready to be delivered. And there appeared another wonder in heaven: for behold, a great red dragon having seven heads, and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads: And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman, which was ready to be delivered, to devour her child, when she had brought it forth. So she brought forth a man child, which should rule all nations with a rod of iron: and that her child was taken up unto Adonai-YHVH and to his throne. And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand, two hundred and threescore days.</p>
<p>Understand my Words O' children of Adonai-Yahweh and know their intent so you may understand just who you are and what has been accomplished in secret, yet hidden in plain sight to forge you in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>Understand my Words O' children of Adonai-Yahweh that have multifaceted meaning and depth, because I AM the Everlasting God of Righteousness who works all things after the council of my own eternal will, Selah.</p>
<p>Understand my Words O' children of Adonai-Yahweh, even these same Words I gave to John the Revelator in his witness of The Revelation of Jesus Christ: The woman called Maryam in Hebrew, even the mother of Yeshua the Nazarene who gave himself as the perfect passover for the sins of Adam, and was caught up into the heavens to sit at Adonai-Yahweh's right hand, who has been recreated eternally forevermore as a life giving spirit.</p>
<p>Understand my Words O' children of Adonai-Yahweh, even these same Words I gave to John the Revelator in his witness of The Revelation of Jesus Christ: There appeared a great wonder in heaven announcing the coming harpazo that is now fully upon you my loves and also announcing the coming rule of that ancient red dragon who will be permissioned for his shortened rule that only serves my purposes of salvation for Jacob after the flesh, and judgment on the fallen ones own heads. Therefore, I announced these events in their times of announcement, and I still am announcing these events in the heavens the wonderful signs of Yeshua HaMashiach appearing for the faithful in Christ!</p>
<p>Look up!</p>
<p>Understand my Words O' children of Adonai-Yahweh, even these same Words I gave to John the Revelator in his witness of The Revelation of Jesus Christ: And there appeared another wonder in heaven: for behold, a great red dragon having seven heads, and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads: And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth. Therefore, understand that the satans and their angels were cast to the earth in defeat in their initial war on Elohim in the heavens and earth of old, and were cast down yet once again and stripped of all power and authority from their now voided agreement made with Adam and Eve and they are now cast to the earth for total and complete judgment which is racing towards them in all wrath and righteous judgment.</p>
<p>Understand my Words O' children of Adonai-Yahweh, even these same Words I gave to John the Revelator in his witness of The Revelation of Jesus Christ: And the dragon stood before the woman, which was ready to be delivered, to devour her child, when she had brought it forth. Understand that the woman is also Christ Jesus Church that is ready to deliver the faithful in Christ as these final birth pangs are suddenly and unexpectedly ended: And a child shall be born!</p>
<p>Understand my Words O' children of Adonai-Yahweh, the woman is also Israel after the flesh, that shall be hidden away, and saved alive in the wilderness in places prepared by the 144,000 at Yeshua HaMashiach's command, direction, and instructions, that he will give you in the heavens so suddenly and unexpectedly now, O' long expected and awaited Warriors of Light!</p>
<p>Therefore, understand these Words mighty children of The Lion of the Tribe of Judah, who has hidden you away and raised you all secretly, even so that Heylel Ben Shachar could never fully find you but only persecute and attack as allowed and permissioned in order to strengthen you so mightily in Christ Jesus. And I will fully recompense you many times over and over for all that you have given and sacrificed for my eternal plans and purposes, and you all will come to be admired by all in that day: Because you are my masterpieces, even the adopted children of Yeshua HaMashiach, even all who will be fully re-birthed and recreated fully so suddenly and unexpectedly now, and you all will marvel at what is about to be revealed in you in my throne room.</p>
<p>So marvelous will you all be, except Yeshua HaMashiach is always the preeminent one, who won your redemption from the hands of my enemies in his love for his Father, and for you, his 144,000 because you are also his adopted children that he has raised personally, as Father to you all. Even though many of you have wonderful parents on this earth, your full adoption is realized when you are born from above so suddenly and unexpectedly now. Understand Christ Jesus' love that I created in his heart, that truly, Christ Jesus sacrificed himself in love to redeem all who will accept redemption and salvation, even making a way for all of Adam, although many multitudes will eternally refuse.</p>
<p>So she brought forth a man child, which should rule all nations with a rod of iron: and that her child was taken up unto Adonai-YHVH and to his throne and herein we have Jesus the Nazarene caught up to heaven, and we have the faithful in Christ re-birthed alive into the heavens at that sudden and unexpected trumpet blast.</p>
<p>And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand, two hundred and threescore days: We have Jacob after the flesh taken and cared for 1260 days during the full wrath of Elohim and the full battle of that great day, Selah.</p>
<p>Therefore, understand who you are my 144,000 because you are the mighty warrior Bride and Queen to the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, even Christ Jesus who is also Yeshua HaMashiach who is The Lion of the Tribe of Judah. Therefore, I command you all to depart from the understandings you naturally have being born into this sin filled and corrupt world, because you are no longer part of this judged and dying world, but are translated directly into the kingdom of Heaven, where your thrones await in the heaven of heavens for your sudden arrival so unexpectedly for you all now.</p>
<p>You will enter covenant with Yeshua HaMashiach because you are his bride. However, to apply earthly understandings to these arrangements is only done in order that you all may understand the magnitude of the covenant you are about to enter, so I command you all to consider fully what you will all consent in your immediate future. Because the Bride of Christ is not a continuation of Adam and Eve, even a holy and consecrated covenant between husband and wife, an institution created for raising children to Adonai-YHVH, the Great I AM. Even a holy institution that would allow for the orderly dispersal and gifting of inheritance and reward and for the blessing and abundant goodness held in Christ Jesus hands to be given in full reward to the faithful.</p>
<p>So it is, that you are all to be recreated as one new man, where there is neither male nor female, but one new man who is freed forevermore from the lusts and corruption of the corrupted form of Adam eternally and forevermore. There will be no evil thought that will attack you, seeking to profane this Holy arrangement that you are all about to enter. And this covenantal arrangement is between the Bridegroom, who is Yeshua HaMashiach, and his mighty warrior Bride and Queen, even his mighty 144,000 who will be Christ Jesus direct household and direct body of guardians and warriors and servants and kings and priests and so mighty will you all be that one of you will literally chase so much more than a thousand, because so mighty will I literally make you all even invincible to all things, yet fully in subjection to Christ Jesus who has eternal authority and power over you all. Selah!</p>
<p>So it is, that the 144,000 are also Yeshua HaMashiach's adopted children, even taken from Judean and Gentile alike and to now be forevermore grafted fully into The Israel of God where they will take their places in their assigned tribes and orders. Then 12,000 from each tribe in the Israel of Adonai-Yahweh will all be sealed in their foreheads and prepared accordingly for their holy and eternal functions. And you all will inherit so mightily and completely all things given to Christ Jesus as his overcomers, according as your faithfulness and obedience has been! There never has been anything in my creation created like you, except Christ Jesus like whom you are to be fashioned, because I hid you all in my heart so long ago and now is the time of your full revealing. Rejoice!</p>
<p>Therefore, understand that convergence has arrived now, and I have given the midnight cry to Yeshua HaMashiach that he may go quickly now, and gather his Bride, and our guests. For the guests are all the faithful in Christ who are taken into the heavens whether they died faithfully asleep in Christ, or whether you are alive and remain, ready to be taken into the heavens at the sound of that mighty trumpet. So understand what has happened and what is to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Your betrothal to Jesus the Nazarene began at Calvary where he fully redeemed you all by his eternal and sinless sacrifice of eternal love and obedience perfectly to the eternal will of Adonai-Yahweh.</p>
<p>The Grooms departure occurred when he was taken into the clouds all these jubilees ago as his apostles stood gazing into the sky in shocked surprise, while two heavenly messengers asked them why they were gazing into the sky, that this same Yeshua HaMashiach would return in like manner.</p>
<p>The wait has continued all this time now during Christ Jesus age of grace where the invitation went to the farthest corners of the earth in announcement and expectation, and Christ Jesus church, his body, and even his Bride have responded and accepted.</p>
<p>And so now, Jesus the Nazarene, who is also Christ Jesus, who is also Yeshua HaMashiach, has received the midnight cry from his Father, even Adonai-Yahweh, The Great I AM, Himself! And I have told him the time, and in his hand a mighty and special trumpet that is tuned to a special frequency that can be understood only by those who are now tuned to that same frequency by Christ Jesus hands. Therefore, the shofar is given to sound, and this announcement now goes forth in all hurried excitement!</p>
<p>Therefore, ready yourselves as commanded because the Father has suddenly given command to the Bridegroom to gather his Bride... Rejoice!</p>
<p>Prepare yourselves! Behold! I Adonai-Yahweh do send forth the midnight cry to my only begotten Son, to go and gather to himself his bride and our guests so suddenly and unexpectedly now!</p>
<p>Prepare yourselves for the wedding feast!</p>
<p>The Midnight Cry is now active!!</p>
<p>That trumpet is to sound!</p>
<p>Ready yourselves and run to the wayside!!</p>
<p>Light your lamps now!!</p>
<p>Midnight is approaching!!</p>
<p>Set you watch in all diligence and immediately prepare yourselves for the wedding of the Bridegroom to the Bride that has come and the hour of your full redemption is here!</p>
<p>Understand who are the guests my children because you are eternally honored and showered in reward and recreated in righteous perfection and you will all marvel at the perfection with which you are to be recreated and now clothed, Selah!</p>
<p>Behold! All the faithful in Christ Jesus are eternally and forevermore Sons of Adonai-Yahweh, and you all will be recreated so suddenly and unexpectedly now, and you all will marvel, and you all will be so richly rewarded, although some will suffer loss, you all will be forevermore redeemed with eternal life in service to Christ Jesus, as one new man and you are the body of Christ! Great is your reward, rejoice!</p>
<p>The guest are Christ Jesus Church and his body. You are part of the faithful in Christ Jesus, and you are part of the eternal godhead according as your faithfulness has been. And you all will be rewarded as promised and given great possessions, and recompense and full inheritance of reward in Christ Jesus who will lavishly shower you in my love so suddenly and unexpectedly now!</p>
<p>Because the Bridegroom has now arrived, and is arrayed in great power, and sits with so many of you, as you rush about your lives in worried expectation. Therefore, cease your worries now my loves because the hour of your redemption has come and is upon you now my loves.</p>
<p>Therefore, have great faith and comfort in these Words that are given in faithful announcement because the midnight cry has now been given, and announced, and the Bride is prepared and has adorned herself in righteousness given to her in Christ Jesus, and our guests are clean and ready and stationed by the way side.</p>
<p>Behold! I AM Adonai-Yahweh, and I send this midnight cry in the hands of my mighty messenger and servant because I have released these Words from the depths of his spirit, where Yeshua HaMashiach has mightily and supernaturally sewn them forevermore.</p>
<p>Therefore, understand just who and what Biblaridion:144 is, and is also to become when he is recreated fully and changed with you all so suddenly and unexpectedly now, and so I will unlock John the Revelator's Words yet again in fulfillment and understanding.</p>
<p>Then I saw another <strong>Angel </strong><strong>(messenger)</strong> fly in the midst of heaven, having an everlasting Gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation and kindred, and tongue, and people, Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him: for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven and earth, and the sea and the fountains of waters. And there followed another <strong>Angel </strong><strong>(messenger)</strong>, saying, Babylon that great city is fallen, it is fallen: for she made all nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. And the third <strong>Angel </strong><strong>(messenger)</strong> followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or on his hand, The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, yea, of the pure wine, which is poured into the cup of his wrath, and he shall be tormented in fire and brimstone before the holy Angels, and before the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment shall ascend evermore: and they shall have no rest day nor night, which worship the beast and his name.</p>
<p>Hear my Words, and understand what is to come!</p>
<p>Biblaridion:144 will command the power of the seven thunders and is now currently an agent of declarative judgment, because he is declaring now into the earth at my command given in Christ Jesus into his spirit exactly what is to happen in full detail on the earth during Daniel's seventieth week, even events that have already started by his announcement in Christ Jesus at my command.</p>
<p>Then, so suddenly and unexpectedly now, you will all be changed and harpazoed into the heaven of heavens where you will be sealed and prepared for your full missions. Then Biblaridion:144 along with two other mighty warriors who are chosen, yet currently hidden vessels (who are currently in preparation), will go into the earth at Yeshua HaMashiach command where Biblaridion:144 will read and declare full judgment as he then commands the powers of the seven thunders in execution because these three chosen vessels will be declarative and executive agents of judgment, each with their own testimony and judgments, even sent forth into the earth in great power and wrath for my eternal purposes that are currently partially concealed but will be given into Yeshua HaMashiach 144,000 but especially the power of the seven thunders that have been prepared to be commanded by The Lion of The Tribe of Judah by way and at command of this tri-part power of war and holy and righteous judgment! Selah!</p>
<p>Prepare yourselves for your destruction and judgment and eternal torment, Heylel Ben Shachar, because my eternal fury is prepared fully for you now little prince.</p>
<p>Tick tock the seconds vanish: you have always been bound in my hand and you are mine.</p>
<p>Behold! I AM the Great I AM and I do bring and announce the midnight cry because the Father of the Bridegroom has given announcement with trumpet in hand and he has arrived to gather his Bride at that exact and perfect time!</p>
<p>Do not leave your posts, nor the havens I have given you so that you may hide yourselves in preparation  and that you may run to the wayside where The Bridegroom will snatch away his Bride, and our guests, into the safety of the heavens at command now!</p>
<p>Behold! Understand the excitement of the Father of the Bridegroom, because I AM more excited than any in my creation who expects your arrival, or who expects to arrive into the heavens even re-birthed eternally and forevermore as Sons of the Adonai-Yahweh, even recreated by Christ Jesus so suddenly and unexpectedly now.</p>
<p>I do so completely and utterly love you all my faithful children with a love that burns so deep that I will take all eternity to personally show each of you personally in my love and recompense and eternal love to all of my creation.</p>
<br>
<p>Signed with my own name and in my full love given by the hand of my mighty messenger and servant,</p>
<p><em>The Father of the Bridegroom, The Great I AM: Adonai-YHVH.</em></p>
