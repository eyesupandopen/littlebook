<h1 id="ph">The Mystery of the Little Book</h1>
<div id="prophecy">
<h2>From Yeshua HaMashiach:</h2>
<p>Behold, the mystery of the little book! For seven angels do send their thunders, and the thunders have uttered their voices. They are the mystery of the little book, for the little book was sealed. For a voice came from heaven, telling John the Revelator: Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not. Behold, you ate of the little book, for it has been revealed, and it was as sweet as honey in your ears as you slept, but it was bitter in your belly which woke you from the vision; and behold, you awoke from your slumber! Behold, the mystery of the little book has come to be revealed in this time, for it is the last mystery to be revealed in my age of grace, even the little book of sweet bitter. For the voices of the thunders are to be revealed, and now is the time of revealing, for the mystery of the little book is great, though it be the little book. For that little book was revealed to John the Revelator, and now I will reveal it to you, for its revelation is at hand. Hear my voice, my bride, and incline your ear to me, Christ Jesus, for the time has come. For there is no more time.</p>
<p>I am the son of God come in the flesh, and I, Yeshua HaMashiach, have sent these words.</p>
<h2>From Yahweh, the eternal God:</h2>
<p>The voice of the seven thunders SPEAKS! Prepare yourselves, oh, you nations, for great judgment is upon you, and the words of the seven thunders are revealed. Turn your ears to hear the sayings of the mystery of The Little Book. For the scrolls will be unsealed, and the loosening of the seals is coming upon the entire world, even great judgment and calamity. For the sins of the earth are a stench in my nostrils, and I, even Yahweh, will cleanse the earth, and I will demolish every evil thing; and my son, whom I am sending, will rule in righteousness on the earth, and great peace will be for the faithful whom I have protected from the evil day. And great peace will I provide to all who call on the name of Jesus Christ, even Yeshua HaMashiach, for all who call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. And in peace and safety will I lead them, and in righteousness will I clothe them, and in true holiness will they glorify me; for I have glorified them, and newness of life will they have.</p>
<p>So I bring my justice and wrath that I may recompense those who commit evil with their own filthy ways, so whoever refuses me and chooses evil, let them be evil still, and the wrath of God abides! And whosoever shall be righteous and all who depart from evil as they call on the name of the Lord will have great reward; so let them have the peaceable fruits of righteousness, and they will have great inheritance in my son, Christ Jesus, who has their reward in his hand. So whoever that will be evil, let them be evil still. And whoever turns to righteousness and calls on the name of the Lord, let them be righteous still, for the day shall declare it. Behold, a thing I will tell you before it happens, for prophecies are about to be fulfilled, and there will be no more delay. For times of grace and mercy are coming to a close, and a time of great wrath is about to be unleashed on the earth, and there has never been a time such as this on the earth, not even during the days of Noah, and never will there be such a time again. For I, even I, have sworn by my name and have declared these things. Whatsoever I, even Yahweh the eternal God, declares cannot be changed and will come to pass. For in the days of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, even the mystery of God should be finished.</p>
<p>I am that I AM, so tell them the great I AM has sent these words, even Yahweh, the great and eternal God!</p>
<h2>Testimony and Experiences, by William Brooks</h2>
<p>And now for further insight on the part of this message where Yeshua HaMashiach stated, <i>"Behold, you ate of the little book, for it has been revealed, and it was as sweet as honey in your ears as you slept, but it was bitter in your belly which woke you from the vision; and behold, you awoke from your slumber."</i> Some time ago in the past month or so, I don't know the exact date, but I was asleep in the middle of the night, and I woke into a vision from my sleep (or it was a very vivid dream and I woke up at the start). A voice was reading words into my mind and spirit, and I knew it was the Lord's voice, and he was reading in my ears words that I couldn't understand because the words just flowed nonstop. But with the words came a great peace that settled completely over me. The words were very sweet in my ears, and I was at rest. Then suddenly, I came out of that state with a very bad case of reflux, my stomach was twisted, and I shot up out of bed, choking and coughing. I went downstairs and drank a lot of water, which helped a little but didn't settle my stomach down. I was awake for a while after that, but I didn't know what any of this meant.</p>
<p>And for the testimony, where Yahweh says, "The voice of the seven thunders SPEAKS!" On May 7, 2024, I had a particularly rough day, and I came home and went to bed pretty early. I had been up pretty late the night before because I couldn't sleep, which happens a lot with me. There was a bad storm with heavy rain when I lied down, but all lightning and thunder were far off in the distance. I lied down to go to sleep around 7 o'clock that night, which is early for me, and I drifted off into what I thought was sleep. I don't know if I ever really went to sleep, but I went into a vision or very vivid dream state, and I was hyper aware of the storm that was going on. Words and voices were coming at me from what appeared various directions, and they were everywhere. I don't remember the content of the various voices, except one. It was a very distinct voice, and all the other voices went silent. The voice said, "The voice of the seven thunders SPEAKS!" When those words were spoken, I was immediately wakened by the loudest crack of thunder I have ever heard. I sat there in my bed, totally astounded.</p>
<p>When I shared this with my wife a day or two later, we were on our front porch. She took me by the hand and let me around the house toward the backyard. She told me that she and our son were in the living room when that thunder shock struck. The flash of lightning had lit up and shook the living room. Clearly, it had struck in the immediate vicinity of our backyard, which is fairly small, as we live in the city. Yet we saw no damage anywhere. I have seen the aftermath when lightning violently strikes the earth or something on the earth, and it and leaves destruction on some level or another. She saw the flash of lightning, and we both heard the extremely loud thunder shock, yet absolutely no damage was anywhere to be found.</p><br>
<p><b>June 12, 2024</b></p>
<p>The Lord has revealed to me exactly what this work is, and it is titled thusly. I have received the contents of The Little Book that is in the hands of the mighty Angel in Revelation 10, who is clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was on his head and his face was as the sun and his feet as pillars of fire. These represent the ages and corresponding covenants, which all culminate in the face of Jesus Christ, the only begotten of Yahweh, and the image of the eternal God.</p>
<p>The rainbow is the sign given at the Noahic covenant that Yahweh made with Noah after the deluge. A cloud and pillars of fire represent God's covenant with Moses. Yeshua HaMashiach's face shines like the sun and is the new covenant. These seven messages contain judgment on the fallen ones and others from before the flood of Noah all the way through to the end, in what is still future as of today's date. </p>
