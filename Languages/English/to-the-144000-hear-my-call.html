<h1 id="ph">To the 144,000: Hear my Call!</h1>
<div id="prophecy"> 
<p>Oh hear, Oh hear, my twelve tribes, the voice of your Messiah, Lord, King and High priest, even me, Yeshua HaMashiach, the Son of Man whom Yahweh raised from the dead. For:</p>
<p>I am your true Messiah, who is descended from the throne of David, and it is from his throne that I will rule the Land of Promise for Yahweh, the eternal God, for so he promised your Fathers. And so understand that I am the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, and no king or prophet has been given from Dan, from where the false prophet comes.</p>
<p>I am your Lord, for Yahweh has made me Lord of Lords, and I have purchased you with my own blood as your perfect Passover, even given for the sins of Gentile and Judean alike, that you both may be one new man in me, even Christ Jesus. For Yahweh has given me a name above every name and caused me to share in His throne on account of my obedience. And so my Lordship is given as a beacon of salvation, for I have been made a life-giving spirit, and only Yahweh is greater than I, for He is the eternal God.</p>
<p>I am your King, for Yahweh has made me King of Kings, and I will rule the earth in righteousness. And behold! I bring my Bride, who will rule with me, for I have made them kings and priests before the eternal Yahweh, of which there is none like Him. For in my promised coming millennial reign, I will be the highest authority, and I will send my kings and priests to rule in their inheritance in me; for I have created them newly in me, even taken from Judean and Gentile alike and made into one new man, even re-created in perfection. I am one in unity and purpose with my Father, Yahweh, and in His throne He is greater than I.</p>
<p>I am your high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek, and I offered my own atoning blood in sacrifice when I gave myself as your perfect and complete Passover. For the Hebrews lend their witness when I had the Apostle Paul address them on my behalf (he was from Benjamin): How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? And so my sacrifice of myself is once and for all and forever, and there is no other Messiah.</p>
<p>Though the synagogue of Satan will receive their false messiah and false prophet who is also a beastly temple builder (for he is the beast from the earth). For you are the temple of the living God, and there is no need of animal sacrifice ever again, for I am the final sacrifice, even the perfect, sinless Passover, and my works are complete and perfect. Therefore, there is never again a need for such a thing, but only that you come to me with your sins in repentance, and I will cleanse you from your dead works of the flesh. For in Romans it is written: For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. For so have I freed you in me.</p>
<p>Understand, my tribes and my people, that the times of the Gentiles are at a close. The times of the Gentiles came about from the hardness of your fathers' hearts. For what did Paul say in Acts on the matter: It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.</p>
<p>I counsel you, my people, do not make the same mistakes and do not live the sins of your fathers, but repent of your own sins and also repent of the sins of your fathers, and come to me and I will receive you, for you are children of promise. And every yod or a thorn of a yod will be fulfilled; for what has been promised by Yahweh is impossible to change, for it is impossible for Yahweh to lie. Therefore, I am the fulfillment of many, many promises, for I am your true Messiah, even the image of the eternal God. For I am his only begotten son, even the Lamb of God whom John the Baptist identified for all time. For he said: Behold the Lamb of God which takes away the sin of the World!</p>
<p>And so I turned to the nations because my own land rejected me, even after I died for their sins and was resurrected. For I sent my apostles and prophets to them, and many were saved. For in the beginning of the age of grace, I sent them into the Temple and the synagogues, and many turned to me and accepted me as their Lord. And so I am calling you to be made whole in my Lordship, for I have redeemed you to my Father that you too may be His children by way of my spirit with which I will seal you. And so the times of the Gentiles are over, for now they too have rejected me in favor of another Jesus they worship as god, thus making themselves idolaters; for Satan thus tempted them. For there is but one God, the eternal Yahweh, and there is but one true Messiah, even me, Yeshua HaMashiach.</p>
<p>For they lost my mysteries, ignored my visions and the purposes of my holy scripture. They lost sight of the Father's plan of redemption, and they arrogantly reject my words I had recorded to the Romans. For Paul stated: I say, then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. God hath not cast away his people, which he foreknew. And again: What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeks for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded. And so the election was sure for those whom I have chosen from among the tribes; for my apostles were all of the land and of the promise, and so I sent them to the nations, of which your religious leaders blasphemously lie, calling them false. Those same false leaders and worthless shepherds even deny my resurrection, for I have been raised from the dead, and I die no more forevermore.</p>
<p>For what else say the Romans on the subject: David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling block, and a recompense unto them: Let their eyes be darkened that they may not see, and bow down their back always. I say, then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.</p>
<p>For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in. And so I declare that the fullness of the Gentiles has come, and the mysteries of God will be returned to Israel for the obedience of faith. For I will yet save Jacob, and a faithful remnant will turn to me faithfully, in great faith!</p>
<p>And so I am come to provoke jealousy in your hearts for me, Yeshua HaMashiach, and Yahweh the great eternal God who sent me, whom you no longer worship according to knowledge, for the veil of blindness will cover anyone who follows the law of Moses. For what did I say to the Corinthians on the subject: And not as Moses, which put a veil over his face, that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished: But their minds were blinded: for until this day remains the same veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament; which veil is done away in Christ. But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.</p>
<p>For I have fulfilled the law of Moses, for neither you nor your fathers are able to achieve perfect compliance due to the sin in your blood. For I, Yeshua HaMashiach, have fulfilled the law to the fullest, and the law is only perfectly kept by faith in me, Jesus Christ. You are reckoned righteous by your complete identification with me, and so the just shall live by faith. And so I will remove the veil on your hearts so that you may see me, Yeshua, your true Messiah, for I have not abandoned you! And I come to you in the new testament, not the oldness of the letter. For I ratified my new covenant in my own blood, according to the will and promises of Yahweh, for your full redemption. And I will lead you to your inheritance, for the promises of God are yea and amen. Not even a yod or a thorn of a yod will fail, for all is about to be fulfilled; and in time, verily, will I fulfill all, for so am I sent of Yahweh to accomplish.</p>
<p>And so the Gentiles have turned from me like a dog returning to its vomit, and the time has come to leave them to it. For in my age of grace, not one person whom my Father has chosen for salvation has been missed, and none can pluck them from my hand. For those who confessed me, Jesus, as their Lord, with faith in their hearts that God raised me from the dead, were sealed with the holy spirit of promise, and my Father's purposes have been fulfilled in me for them. And so shall they ever be with me.</p>
<p>For the olive tree reveals truth. And what did I say regarding the olive tree in Paul's letter to the Romans: And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them partakes of the root and fatness of the olive tree; Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.</p>
<p>And so they have made the mistakes and taken the sins of your fathers and have turned away from me to their idols, and they will no longer hear my voice. Though if they call on the name of the Lord, they will be saved who love not their lives to the end.</p>
<p>For what else says the witness of the Romans in scripture as a warning to the nations: Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in. Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not high-minded, but fear: For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee. Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again. For if thou were cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?</p>
<p>For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in. And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.</p>
<p>And so, my kinsmen, the times of the Gentiles are at a close, and a huge shift is underway, where my grace will instantly turn to judgment. And even now the pieces are allowed into place by Satan's hand, as he will make his stand, though he will be utterly crushed, and I will completely dismantle his kingdom; for he is no king.</p>
<p>And so now comes the time to graft the natural branches back into the olive tree, for Yahweh's purposes have been fulfilled in the undeserved grace and mercy that was shown to the Gentiles (for God's grace and mercy are undeserved for every man), for even that grace and mercy was utilized to find the lost sheep of the house of Israel. For you should be not ignorant of your own history, providing you put down your blasphemous Babylonian Talmuds and learn of me; for I did not send that book, and you need to repent from those teachings and repudiate Satan's lies. Return to my pure word of God and depart from your fathers' sins, for I will redeem you if you will but hear my voice.</p>
<p>For I was not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. And so the ten tribes were scattered among the nations from their captivity by the Assyrians all this time ago. They have roamed and wandered the earth as pilgrims and sojourners. From Assyria they went into the lands of the north, into Scythia, and Europe, and eventually into the Americas, where I made them a peaceable habitation for a time. And I called all whoever may come from the nations to my salvation. Even many Israelites were saved and have been redeemed as well as many from the nations, who otherwise would have never had hope. And a multitude has responded, and so the times of the Gentiles are over, for there is no more time. But understand that all who call on the name of the Lord shall be saved if they are faithful to the end, for I will receive them regardless of from the nation they originate.</p>
<p>And so it is, that Jacob's trouble comes on the land and the nations, for it is time for great judgment to fall on the earth. And so the beasts by the power of the dragon shall rise; only take not his mark and do not fall for his deceptions. For he has already ingratiated himself to the rulers of your nation, even the synagogue of Satan with their Edomite ways. And he already speaks great blasphemies, for he is being prepared for his true purpose.</p>
<p>For the abomination of desolation is coming. For what did I have my faithful Luke record for all time: And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh. Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto. For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.</p>
<p>And so it shall be at the proper time, and I will protect my own, for I am sending you as my prophets, shepherds, healers, and ministers. For I am calling you to service, even to fulfill your true calling given by promise to the fathers by Yahweh Himself, and by my hand shall they be fulfilled. For Yahweh has set my seat in His throne, and I have shared of my throne with my Bride, who are ever with me. And so there is none on earth greater than me; none of your false prophets compare, for they are all weak and beggarly and sent to deceive and lead astray, for they are worthless shepherds.</p>
<p>Know, my people, that the enemy has set many traps for you, so follow my lead and you will avoid them all. For very soon all pleasures will be taken from the earth. Many will not even find a morsel, and they won't even have a table to eat at but will be fugitives in the earth for their faith in me.</p>
<p>Do not let yourselves be tempted by their false manna that will require the mark of the beast to attain entrance into their perverse society. For the mark will not be forgiven, and all who fall into this trap will not be released; for it is permanent for all who make that final choice of finality, for they will have sealed their fate and that fate is final. So do not be tempted by the bait, or you will wind up in the net and hooked permanently through your jaw.</p>
<p>I am sending you to gather my flock, and I will lead you to them and lead them to you, and you will shepherd them for me, for I am the chief shepherd. You will not deny another race or country or any other nation, for Yahweh's promise stands, and all who call on the name of the Lord will be saved. Do not be stiff-necked as your fathers, and be meek to my voice. For your fathers rejected me, so confess the sins of your fathers and your own in repentance to me, and I will forgive you and shower you in my love and grace, for I will make rivers of living waters flow from your belly. I have empowered you for great miracles. And I am sending you to your brethren to turn them to me, for a remnant will yet be saved; and I will save Jacob from the hand of their enemies, for I have declared it and so it will be fulfilled.</p>
<p>I, even Yeshua HaMashiach that Yahweh has sent, am the true Messiah of Israel and the world. Even I will send my two prophets, even those whom Yahweh snatched from the earth in their times: for such a purpose were they taken, and so shall they be sent. I have many things to say to you and those things will be said, and I will prepare you for your missions, and you will do great and mighty works for me, even works you never imagined possible. For the worst of times always produce great men of Yahweh, even men who will not be broken, for you will rest in my strength, and I am unbreakable. For so has Yahweh made me, and so I will make you. So hear my voice, for I am calling and will send my angels to seal the 144,000 with the seal of Yahweh.</p>
<p>I will keep you in safety from the beast and his abomination; I will hide you, and you will be fed from the heavens even should you need, so fear not. Fear not for your lives, for great reward is yours for service and faithfulness, and I will reward you for your stand.</p>
<div class="indent">
<p>I am the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, and you will hear my roar, for I am calling you.</p>
<p>I am he that will seal 12,000 from each tribe except Dan and Ephraim.</p>
<p>I am he who will crush the lion's whelp that will spring from Dan.</p>
<p>I am he who will defeat the beast and the false prophet, and I will cast them alive into the great lake of fire.</p>
<p>I am he who will lead my people to green pastures by my shepherds, for I am the chief shepherd.</p>
<p>I am he who will fulfill the promises made to the fathers, for so am I sent.</p>
<p>I am he that will crush the head of the Satans, for the princes of this world will pay.</p>
<p>I am he that will rule from the throne of David, for my kingdom has no end.</p>
<p>I am he who is coming in the clouds, and I will come to my own nation and will take my rule, and I will not be stopped.</p>
</div>
<p>I, even I, Yeshua HaMashiach, have sent these words for those whom I am calling. So hear my words in obedience, and know that I will liberate the land and the entire earth and will rule in righteousness. So hear my call, for I am coming to you and will teach you my ways and will guide you into all truth. So reject not my writings, for the oracles of God will be returned to Israel, and the earth will know that there is a God in Israel, even Yahweh, the great eternal God, for there is none else, and there is none like Him. Shalom! Shalom! So be in peace and be well, for I will heal you all to the uttermost who put their faith in Yeshua HaMashiach.</p>
