<h1 id="ph">Behold! Full and Unabridged Declarative Judgments on Secret Babylon: Declared in Full Before Judgment Falls in Full</h1>
<div id="prophecy" class="skiptonropadding">
<p>Full Judgment on Secret Babylon: Declared Sunday June 22, 2025. All excepts taken from The Little Book of Revelation Chapter 10 that has now been revealed from March 2, 2024, to March 20, 2025. All Words given to me by Yeshua HaMashiach and YHVH, the Great I AM via the Spirit of Prophecy which is the testimony of Jesus Christ. Selah!</p>
<p>The following judgments are from The Little Book of Revelation Chapter 10, which is also The Everlasting Gospel of Revelation Chapter 14. Judgment on Secret Babylon has been declared now for many jubilees and years in the Book of Revelation. However, the Seven Thunders and The Little Book have now been revealed and declared and this mighty book is open in my hand and in the hands of all who read this declaration from The Little Flock, even called by Yeshua HaMashiach for such a purpose and time as this! Selah!</p>
<p> Following are declarative Judgments taken from the Little Book that will surely come to pass so suddenly and unexpectedly now. In this capacity, I function as a judicial messenger sent to declare judgments from the throne of YHVH, given in the face of Jesus Christ, whom I do serve. Please note, some of these judgments are underway and some will happen shortly, but all will be fulfilled even as declared and judgment on Secret Babylon will serve as a warning to all nations and the smoke of her torment will rise as righteous declaration of the righteous judgments of Christ Jesus, and also YHVH the Great I AM!</p>
<p>Let it be known, that today even June 22nd, 2025 on the Gregorian Calendar (even the same calendar used by Secret Babylon) that my Ascended Lord Christ Jesus, even Yeshua HaMashiach commands me to read these judgments on Secret Babylon, even these United States of America, so that anyone may repent while there is still a moment of fleeting time, and so that judgment is declared before fire falls. Selah!</p>
<p>This declaration is exhaustive and these are not new judgments but were released in full from March 2, 2024, to March 20, 2025. Therefore, I refer anyone to the Little Book of Revelation chapter 10 at the links provided. Please note: These judgments proceed from Thunder 5 specifically and this reading will begin with The Unrighteous Shall Not Inherit the Kingdom of God, Thunders 5 and 6, given by Yeshua HaMashiach and also YHVH The Great I AM!</p>
<p>Please note, this reading does function as full declarative judgment against Secret Babylon given by The Little Flock before Judgment fully falls. I am the Lord's messenger and servant in this regard and am a judicial agent sent and authorized by YHVH, in the face of Yeshua HaMashiach and it is them I do serve fully in my office.</p>
<p>Please note, this reading also functions as a guide of events that will shortly come to pass, and this is done with the intent that the Lord's people, even the faithful in Christ, and the Bride of Christ who will be raptured so suddenly now. Given so that we know and we can declare the end from the beginning, even before it happens. These events will happen exactly as given by Christ Jesus and also by the hand of YHVH, The Great I AM, from whom all things proceed given in the mighty name and authority of Christ Jesus, who is also Yeshua HaMashiach.</p>
<p>This has taken some time and effort to compile, and serves as a compressed judgment reading on Secret Babylon, and also a ledge of events so that the true Bride of Christ, the Faithful in Christ, and the 144,000 are not led astray by cheap imitations. It is the Little Book that will govern the end times via the Seven Thunders that have now been unsealed, not false prophets who self deploy speaking nonsense from their own hearts. Selah!</p>
<p>Please note: This is intended as a study guide for the faithful so that you will know what is to come and that we all may rest in Christ and rely on HIS Words and not the words of false prophets who neither know our Lord, and who neither speak for him in the least.</p>
<p>I will now move to declare.</p>

<b>From Yeshua HaMashiach:</b>
<p>My son, if thou will receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee; so that you incline your ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding. Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness: and know that I, the Lord Jesus Christ, am ever with you and am ever present in your lives as you hold on to me and my salvation, for I am the head of the Body, and I am your faithful Lord, my beloved Bride. For I have prepared a place and future for you, and there is great reward for my called, and faithful, and chosen.</p>
<p>I have not called you to loss and punishment nor have I called you to shame and self-condemnation; have you not read there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit? So believe my words! I did not call you to live in the shadow of your past sins, nor to live in the shadow of your youthful exploits, but I have called you to die to your old sinful ways and take up newness of life in me as you put off your flesh, as you put off your sins and walk in newness of life in me. Behold! I make all things new! Is this not your hope?</p>
<p>My children, I have taken you from the depravity of this current dying world, and I have delivered you from the power of darkness and have translated you into my kingdom, the kingdom of God, led by me, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, of which Yahweh is God, for there is no other. I have called you to glory and virtue in me, and I have rescued you from the kingdom of Satan, the kingdom of darkness, into my Kingdom, where there is light! So, awake you who sleeps, and arise from the dead, and I, Jesus Christ, will give you light.</p>
<p>Have you not read in the letters I sent to my Bride, that I sent to you, my very Church? Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</p>
<p>Do you not understand my precepts, oh, lukewarm church of Laodicea? I did not call you to return to your flesh, nor did I call you to continue in your unrighteous ways. Think, and consider; let him that thinks he stands, take heed lest he fall! Take heed to yourselves, and to the doctrine: continue in them: for in doing this, thou shalt both save yourself, and them that hear you. Understand, my lukewarm little ones, that you cannot live a life of compromise between good and evil, thinking you are upright before me, when you choose the lesser of two evils in your election rituals that I do not condone or endorse.</p>
<p>Come out of her, my people, as I have NOT provided a political solution, and I have absolutely not given you a world leader to make anything great again. You are deceived, and you are being primed to follow and give consent to the son of perdition who openly walks among you, although he has not been revealed quite yet. But you who ask for discernment will know who he is, so that you may avoid his deception. No, compromise is not for you, as you are my children and brethren, and I did not win your salvation by giving my life as a ransom for many by compromising with Satan; for to compromise is to join their ranks. So make no mistake: You either stand for me in righteousness and true holiness, or you have joined the ranks of Satan in his dying kingdom, so REPENT!</p>
<p>What do you gain by compromise with evil? Do you not understand that you are to overcome evil with good? So stand fast in me and quit flip-flopping like a fish out of water. Many of you are still blown about by every wind of doctrine and sleight of hand, whereby they lie in wait to deceive. I, Christ Jesus, have spoken, and I will not be silenced. So many of you have compromised yourselves and my church, and I ask you: how long halt you between two opinions? If the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. Simply stated, you cannot compromise and choose any form of evil and think you are standing for me; when you choose evil, you choose the sources of that evil as your lord and master becoming the servant of sin. Know ye not, that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey: whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</p>
<p>Hear me and hear me well, my Church; know that I stand in disgust at the practices that are prevalent in your nation and around the world, that you have compromised and allowed into my Church to vex my little ones. As in the days of Noah, so shall it be. The days of Noah were a time when the earth was ruled by evil abominations made by the fallen angels, their very own seed, a seed of evil made for your complete destruction: and they will return, for behold, I bring giants to fulfill my wrath. They accomplished this by removing and violating natural boundaries that my Father set in place so that peace and righteousness could prevail, but by removing and immorally crossing the very boundaries that are obvious in nature itself, that my Father instituted, many of you have polluted yourselves by your consent of the evil prevalent in your times. The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be: and that which is done, is that which shall be done; and there is no new thing under the sun. Have you not read, oh, ye of little faith? Removing God's own boundaries causes insanity, and sickness, and confusion of all things. Many of you revel in mental illness, thinking a man can become a woman and a woman can become a man, and you lead your own children into your delusions. Many of you attend churches led by homosexual false ministers who are open and flamboyant in their sickness, and you think they speak for me? Know this: if you are in that sinful state, I will give you over to the lusts you so wantonly crave, and you will reap the fruit of your unclean ways.</p>
<p>Behold! For this cause, God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one towards another, men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet. But no, it is not enough to be led by the effeminate and their lies; you allow your own children to be compromised and even mutilated before me. There is great consequence in store for these actions, and they will not go unpunished. And yet you persist in your insanity, and unless you repent, I will spew you out of my mouth.</p>
<p>Come to me in repentance, and sit in sackcloth and ashes, that I may know the sincerity of your repentance and weep and howl over your sins so that you do not pay the price in judgment. So many of you are so arrogant because you try to make me Lord while you still have a faithless heart, for with the heart man believes unto righteousness. So have faith that you may be saved; your faith will be indicated to all by your repudiation of sin and coming out of your filthy ways. The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted. But you still consent to the ways of the sodomite, and you help bring great evil on the land, to the point that you actually vote for child molesters to lead your lands. You lack even the most elementary level of discernment, and you do not follow my way; and if you persist, I will completely give you over to your vile affections for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved.</p>
<p>Let me open your eyes, you who are willingly ignorant and blind, you who sit in filth and darkness, rolling in the mire. You cannot give your consent to evil and think you are serving me, for I resisted evil and temptation until the very last drop of blood flowed from me onto the red earth, for I am the last Adam and I have been made a quickening spirit. So many of you are blinded by good words and fair speeches and give your full consent to criminals and horrible people who prey on children. They molest children, they torture children for their own evil lusts: For so comes the wrath of God on Mystery Babylon, but so many of you persist in giving your consent to these brute beasts who are set aside for the eternal hellfires that will never be quenched.</p>
<p>Come out of her, my people, or you will share in her plagues and the awful judgment that is coming on her; and I have warned you. For what concord has Christ with Belial? If you share in her lies, you will share in her plagues; so completely separate yourselves in word and in deed, and do not agree with them in the least. Do not live careless, compromised lives; for I will punish all who do. You think because you have eternal life that you can't experience great loss and consequence? I will strip your rewards and give them away, and you will be the least in the kingdom of heaven if you persist, for so says Yeshua HaMashiach, the Bridegroom, to my Bride!</p>
<br>
<b>From Yahweh, the Great Eternal God:</b>
<p>Oh, you worthless ones who harm my creation, you worthless ones who have sold yourselves to Satan, you worthless ones who have made Satan your God, you worthless ones who reject my son Jesus Christ and the salvation I have provided in his name, you worthless ones who have allowed your own children to burn in the fires of Moloch. I will give you the world you desire, and I have prepared you a world without me, a world without my son Christ Jesus, a world with a great lake of fire and brimstone just for you.</p>
<p>I will give you the darkness you so desire, for my light will not be present there, and you will spend eternity separated from me, Yahweh, the great brilliant God, whose glory and brightness no flesh can behold and who is from everlasting to everlasting. You rebellious, evil ones who have destroyed my creation from the beginning in your lusts and hate and jealousy, know that you have heaped great punishment and torment to yourselves from which you will never be healed and to all who are led astray by your lies and refusing Jesus Christ, refusing to turn from your lies to my truth.</p>
<p>You think that perverting my ways and removing my boundaries is a light thing, but you will understand my wrath as soon as the first flame touches you, and you will be engulfed in fire and brimstone of which you will never escape. Furthermore, you have murdered, raped, plundered, molested, hurt, killed, destroyed, and participated in the most grievous offenses, even desiring strange flesh; and you have joined yourselves to the fallen angels, so I will join you to the lake of fire that I have prepared for the Devil and his angels, and you will not escape. You have no peace.</p>
<p>I will exact justice on you, for I am a God of justice, and I am a God of vengeance. Yet, you will arrogantly stand against me, pleading your case, thinking that I will somehow shrink from your satanic ways of: do what you will, shall be the whole of the law. You have no peace. I will repay, and you say that I am a loving God (which I am), but then you expect me not to exact justice on those who have polluted my creation, on those who tortured and killed my only begotten son as he gave himself a ransom for all; yea, you expect me not to exact justice on you for your worthless ways when you have killed, tortured, and maimed the innocent and you have starved my little ones for your own agendas.</p>
<p>Indeed, Satan himself would destroy all that is of me for his own greedy gain, and even then you try and accuse me of folly in my righteous judgments when I come to protect my own. Your days of leading my little ones astray are about to come to an end. Behold! Your beast and false prophet will utterly be destroyed, and I will cast them alive into that great lake burning with fire and brimstone; they will wait for you to join them in your inheritance.</p>
<p>Great judgment is on you, oh, prince of darkness; your kingdom and all that follow you are about to be utterly destroyed. For you are no gods, and you cannot deliver your worthless selves from my hand, and I will chain you in the deepest darkness that you so desire, even the deepest abyss will I chain you with a great chain that you cannot break. Yea, in the abyss you will be for one day, for one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. And even then I will loose you for a little season that you may tempt and gather the very last of those abominable ones who would follow you and your ways. And I will then consume all of you with fire, and the thrones of judgment will be set, and I will judge all of you evildoers, and you will go to everlasting punishment from the face of the Lord. You will burn in the presence of the angels and in the presence of the lamb, and they will behold you in torment and punishment, for you have wronged them all, and you will fully pay for your sins for all eternity.</p>
<p>Then you will be sealed in your prison, and you will be forgotten, and you will never again come to mind, for the former things will pass away and be forgotten. For behold, I will make a new heaven and new earth wherein dwells righteous; and I, Yahweh, the great eternal God of all gods, for there is none like me, behold, I will make all things new, for I, Yahweh have spoken it! Yahweh, the great eternal God, will make his throne on earth, and my dwelling place will be amongst men, and you will never again be, oh, you worthless ones, and you will forever burn in your forgotten prison of torment that you can never escape, for I will set the seal and none can break it.</p>
<p>Yet, so many of you who sympathize with Satan accuse me of folly for taking justice and vengeance into my own hands to deliver those who made themselves worthy of everlasting punishment to the flames. Hear my words, oh, dwellers of the earth: my Son is coming, and he comes with great vengeance, anger, and fury for the wrongs done by your hands. The times of judgment, even the judgment of the great day of Christ is about to explode across the earth, and there will be no remedy for the evil ones, no remedy for Satan, and no remedy for all who have joined him, as all will go into eternal perdition, and I will give back to them all that they have inflicted on the innocent.</p>
<p>Therefore, I will inflict their evil hearts' desires and all their evil works right back on them for all eternity. See my anger boiling and know that the times of restitution of all things is at hand, and no numbers are left on the clocks in the heavens, for all the numbers have fallen from the clock face, for time is up! I counsel all who read these words to run to my son Jesus Christ in repentance and make him Lord; for no one will come to me except through Jesus Christ, for no other name have I given for salvation, and all of your idols will burn. There is time yet for salvation, and whosoever calls on the name of the Lord to the end will be saved. So run to Jesus Christ while you still can, for the day of the Lord has come, and I will unleash my Son, and the wrath of the Lamb will be satisfied. Kiss the Son lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little: Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.</p>

<p>Judgment will fall on Babylon the Great shortly, and a terrible judgment it will be, but it is deserved. Oh, man, how long shall I endure you? You have gone from a nation of saints that served as a beacon to the world to come to me, to a nation of adulterous harlots. I have separated my people from you, and the separation is nearly consummated as this age of grace comes to a close. Oh, man, why do you follow the evil one, accepting his worthless bribes over me, the eternal Christ, in all my splendor and glory.</p>
<p>My Father gave time for all nations to repent, and many people, even a great multitude, have accepted my offer in my saving grace showered on them. Yet you, oh, natural man who refuses the things of the spirit and despises his neighbor, will endure great judgment on your land, and Babylon the Great shall never be again. Babylon, you have become a nation of harlots who play the role with your skirts above your heads like a wild ass in heat waiting for the next passerby. You have defiled yourselves with strange flesh, you have relished and loved your sins, and eternal judgment will fall on all the hard-hearted who count my sacrifice but a light and worthless thing to behold. You have become a nation of evildoers and truce breakers who change wives like old garments for new until the new is soiled. Your great words you have spoken against my Father will be held to account.</p>
<p>Your worthless imaginations will be laid in front of you, and you will give an account. But your account will never be enough to stand righteous before me. Your very existence has been corrupted, and in your insanity you have chosen your decaying flesh, for as my Father said, ye shall surely die. Yet, it still seems strange to you that in dying you shall die. Although your full expiration was not instant, you have been dying since the day of your first breath. Judgment has been declared on your nation, and do not the heavens shout the same? I will utterly destroy your land, and your great towers shall fall, and thick blackness shall cover the earth. Your walls are already breached, and millions have come for you to take from you what I have given them, because I will fatten the hand of your enemies in your judgment. Your time is nearly over, and you are a chained nation before me, waiting for my angels to come in judgment. You will fall greatly as the waters come on you, as the shaking comes on you, as the armies are unleashed, and your land shall be cleaved asunder. Famine shall settle over the world, and war will come to the entire world as the beast rises from the ashes in their long-planned schemes.</p>

<p>But in your arrogance and worldly ways, you have hardened your hearts against me and my salvation. Therefore, utter destruction will come upon your nation in one hour, and Mystery Babylon shall be no more. Yea, Babylon the great, your secrets will be yet exposed for all to see, and those who cling to you will suffer the same judgment.</p>
<div class="quotedlink jb-header"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro4">4</span><a href="/prophecy/watchman-awake">Watchman Awake! (Judgment on Mystery Babylon, USA)</a><span>April 5, 2024</span></div>
<p>I am coming, and I will not hold my peace, and my anger is hot against Secret Babylon, yea, Secret Babylon who traffics the little ones for merchandise into the hands of evil men, who will be stopped. It would be better that they had never been born than to be born and commit lawless and grievous sins against the children. It would be better that a millstone were hung around their necks, and they were cast into the seas; but they are reserved for everlasting fire, and justice will soon be done, as the wrath of the Lamb is about to cover the entire earth and Jacob's trouble breaks loose when the restrainer is removed.</p>
<p>So my people, my faithful bride whom I love dearly, what is there for you to fear? My wrath and the wrath of your Father is not for you and will not come upon you, and never will you be in danger of the second death. So fear not as I will exact perfect vengeance on your adversaries, for vengeance is mine, saith the Lord! Know ye not that you will judge angels? Know ye not that you will judge the world? So purify yourselves in me, for it is only my atoning blood that will make you worthy to stand before me in glory. Bind my word in your hearts, and keep my writings in your forehead, and rest in my sayings of old; for life they are unto you, and your life is hid in me, and I will reveal it!</p>
<p>Oh, Secret Babylon, that you had understood the peace offering my Father has sent you, and you have now rejected me, Jesus the Nazarene, and it has happened according to the holy writings that evil men and seducers will wax worse and worse. But you, oh, Secret Babylon the great, have desecrated my Father's bow of many colors that he gave to Noah and all mankind as a promise that he would never destroy the entire earth by water again, and he will keep his word. But you, oh, Mystery Babylon, will be laid waste in one hour.</p>
<p>Great fire will come upon you; great shaking will flatten you; your towers will fall; your infrastructure will disappear in ruins, and great waves will overtake your coasts, and I will reward you according to your works, and great judgment is against you. For you were once a beacon of hope and a light to the world for a short season, but you have chosen greed, selfishness, and corruption as your bedfellows, oh, great harlot! Who will save you from me and my anger and my approaching wrath that is hot on you? You stand in chains, awaiting your final judgment, which will be evident for the world to see, and great fear will come on many.</p>
<p>Behold! Many nations my Father has overthrown in judgment, for he sets up one and brings down another, for Yahweh is sovereign and there is none greater than the great eternal God who stands for and saves his own from the fires reserved for the evil ones. Behold! The nations that made up great empires still remain, yet in a diminished way, but continued they have. But you, oh, great harlot, you have prostituted yourself with many lovers for base greediness and the pleasures of sin. You have led my people away from me worldwide by the filth you have offered the nations to eat and drink, and you will be utterly cast down, and never again will you be. And of your ashes a great nation will not arise, yet a remnant will be saved.</p>
<p>The hand of the enemy is on your necks, and I have brought the dregs into your borders. They will pillage, plunder, and seize what remains. Who will help you? For you have denied your neighbor, and there is no fear of the Lord in your hearts. You have said, I am no widow, yet you are widowed and blind and deaf before me. There is no salvation for you on account of your adulterous fornication that you have committed with the world; therefore, I will bring you to utter ruin.</p>
<p>Coming events will happen faster and faster; then a great deluge will cover your skirts. Fire will burn you utterly and will cleanse the evildoers from the land, and my captives will be freed, and nothing can stop what is about to happen. I am the Lord Jesus Christ, and I tell you before it happens, and I declare what is about to happen as if it has occurred already, for certain are these sayings, and nothing can alter them, as prophecies shall be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Stand firm, my people, as I will catch my bride away; for I have plans and purposes for her in my coming kingdom. She will always be with me, and she will never depart from me. I love and cherish her in perfect love and compassion. I will make you mighty in my glory, and you will do mighty works in your coming inheritance, so fear not. Know that my heart breaks, and I am saddened by my people who have not readied themselves. Some will be left behind because the god of this world has blinded their minds, and many are not ready. Fear not, though you will endure much for me, all of you will be saved who carry the seal of the living God. I will provide for you if you do not deny my name, if, and you labor for me in the work I have given you.</p>
<p>There is no pleasure in the coming destruction that will soon overtake your world. Natural disasters will abound, and the earth shall quake, and great waves will crash on Mystery Babylon; for the earth will be ripped apart in many places. Great fire will overtake the land, and the merchants will stand afar off for fear of her torment. Great destruction is on the harlot, Babylon the great, who has made the world drunk with her adulteries and fornications, for she has had many lovers. Those who will not separate themselves from her will share in her judgment, so why would you yet choose death over the life I have given you, paid for in my own sinless blood?</p>
<p>War is about to come fully on your land and nation, and even though it is already underway — yes, an undeclared war they fight against you — soon it will break across the entire world as the seals are loosed. Great war and great persecution will come over the earth as they will try to destroy anything of God and his Christ as they will eventually openly declare holy war on you. They will capture many, and many will be taken, and those who will be saved will have but one choice: endure to the end and love not their lives until the end and call on my name till the end.</p>
<p>Your own leaders have betrayed you and will sacrifice many to the wicked one in the battles that will soon rage. Your nation will be attacked from within and from without. The red armies are already here, and they await their orders; for they plan a surprise attack, and many will be taken. The armies of the evil one will take everything from the land for their own and from those who reject me. They will steal your land, your homes, your posterity; and many lives will be lost in unbelief. War is coming from without as many nations are aligned against you; and they have your leaders' consent, and your leaders work for your deaths. They want a world of their own, a world dedicated to Satan where they can fully follow the evils that dwell in them, and nothing will restrain their evil desires, as the restrainer will be gone.</p>
<p>They will utterly burn Secret Babylon with fire, and whoever does not succumb to the flames will succumb to famine; whoever does not succumb to famine will succumb to pestilence; whoever does not succumb to the edge of the sword will be delivered to the gallows for my name, and many will be beheaded as my Holy Word declares. And those who are martyred for my name will have great reward, and I will wipe all tears from their eyes. Know, my children, that all delicacies and pleasures of sin that evil men treasure to themselves will but vanish into thin air, and tribulation and anguish will stand in their places. Darkness will cover the land, and there will be a dearth of my Word, and the voice of the bride and the voice of the bridegroom will not be heard in her anymore.</p>
<div class="quotedlink pa-header"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro5">5</span><a href="/prophecy/sinners-come-to-me-in-this-last-time">Sinner Come to me In This Last Time!</a><span>May 10, 2024</span></div>
<p>There is so little time remaining, and Jacob's trouble is about to break forth across the earth, and men's hearts will fail them for the severity of what is coming. Satan has prepared many abominations that he will unleash, for to refuse my call is to choose Satan's kingdom of death and destruction; and I will leave you to your choice, and I will give you the darkness and misery you so love, and you will eat of the fruit of your ways unless you repent. For this is it, this is the last call before judgment swiftly comes. Even my servants and ministers cry to the ends of the earth this very second, except they will cry for your salvation until they are snatched away to me in the clouds when I come for my bride in the air shortly, and this will happen unexpectedly, though I tell you plainly before it happens. And then my last call of grace and mercy will be over. And when I snatch my bride to safety, sudden destruction will break across the earth, and many of you who hear these words will not escape. Some of you foolishly think you can continue to abuse my grace and it will continue indefinitely, but the sad truth is that grace will turn to judgment, and it will happen suddenly, and many will not escape.</p>
<p>For those who are not killed by this sudden destruction soon to be unleashed on Mystery Babylon will find themselves in a world they never dreamed possible, a world where there is constant death and destruction, for Satan will systematically purge anything to do with me, Jesus Christ, and he will do it unmercifully. There will be torment across the land and wanton cruelty, and to come to me during this time of judgment and testing will be the most difficult; but whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved, and they will have to endure to the end, and many will lose their heads, and many will die in great torment.</p>
<p>But even then, God will wipe away all tears from their eyes, for John the Revelator declared concerning them: These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore, are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his Temple: and he that sitteth on the Throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore, neither shall the Sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them unto the living fountain of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.</p>

<p>For very soon and suddenly, when I gather my Church to me in the clouds, sudden destruction will overtake the earth; for they will destroy Secret Babylon, and great war will break across the land and sudden destruction will overtake the earth. The unholy trio will rise from the ashes of the ruins and chaos left by the horseman, who are soon to be unleashed after my Bride is snatched away to me in the heavens. (For only then will I open the seals of my testament for my Church is saved from the wrath to come, and I will rescue them.) They will rise from the ashes of war, pestilence, famine, and great injustice, and from the deaths of many, many multitudes.</p>
<p>At the time of their revealing they will throw off their disguises of lowly civil servants; and all the pomp, even their mangy cloaks of mangy sheepskins and their true nature, power, and purposes will be revealed. The world will wonder after them and their ways, even worshiping them to their own destruction. They will step on the world stage in great power, and an alliance of ten kings will rule. Even now, the alliance has already arrayed their hosts in secret for a secret attack on Secret Babylon. They have secretly set themselves to the ready, and they have surely coordinated an attack, and they have openly invaded Secret Babylon according to the judgment declared by God that is about to befall her, of which she shall never again rise.</p>
<div class="quotedlink jn-header"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro7">7</span><a href="/prophecy/hear-my-words-and-understand-the-times-in-which-you-live">Hear My Words and Understand the Times in Which You Live!</a><span>May 23, 2024</span></div>
<p>Hear my Words, my people, even all whom I am calling, and understand the times in which you live. For the world you now know will cease to exist, and in its place many wastelands will remain, even the ashes and ruins of Mystery Babylon, for war has come. For as I snatch my Bride into the heavens, great calamity will engulf Mystery Babylon, and she shall be destroyed in one hour, and in one hour shall she be destroyed, and nothing can change her fate, for Yahweh has so declared.</p>
<p>For you, Secret Babylon, you have rejected my voice and set me, Jesus Christ the Righteous, aside for the pleasures of sin. For even the great warnings given over your nation in the heavens served only to provide entertainment for your faithless hearts and lustful eyes, and to you it was just another day as you lived deliciously in your sins that are leading you to your destruction. You should have repented!</p>
<p>For you have become a nation of idolaters, a nation of warmongers, a nation who feasts on lies and who loves their delusions, a nation who has filled the earth with your abominations; and the nations drink of your golden cup which is full of abominations and filthiness of your fornication.</p>
<p>Therefore, I am against you, and your destruction is here and has already begun, for you have ignored the call of Yahweh given through me, Yeshua HaMashiach, and I would have saved you. And I have wept over your hard-hearted ways, but you still will not turn from evil; so I have turned away from you, and the times of the Gentiles are about to be brought to full completion as I catch away the faithful in my Church at the trumpet's call.</p>
<p>But you are a nation bound in chains, and you will utterly be destroyed, and you will never rise again. As my Bride is taken, the world will wonder in great astonishment at what they witnessed, for this event will not happen in secret, but openly, that all the world may know that there is a God in heaven and that he has sent me, Christ Jesus, for the gold, silver, and precious stones of the earth. For the Father's greatest treasures, even the pearls of great price, will be taken away from the judgment and destruction to come.</p>
<p>For my Bride is saved from wrath on account of my sacrifice, and I will rescue the faithful and those found faithful in Christ at the time of my appearing and all who have died faithful in Christ, even sealed by me, Christ Jesus, for I have been made a life-giving spirit. And I will resurrect the dead in Christ, and those which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them to meet me in the clouds. So understand that this event is to reward the faithful and to consummate the marriage of the Bridegroom to my Bride, for we will be forever joined in covenant and never will they depart from me. And I am he who will make them kings and priests before my Father.</p>
<p>And so they will leave the earth, and so the world will see, and many will wonder in great astonishment. For in part, the reason for this event is to engender repentance among those who are left behind, even those who refused my call during the age of grace, and also many who have not heard enough to believe who will be saved during Jacob's trouble, especially those of the land of promise.</p>
<p>For I am calling you, oh, Israel: are you ready to hear the voice of your true Messiah, the Lion of the Tribe of Judah? For the voice of your true Messiah is calling, and I am he who will rule from the throne of David in the holy city, even I, Yeshua HaMashiach; only ignore not the words of my call!</p>
<p>And so the age of grace, even the times of refreshing, are now closing out in finality. And so that finality will fully arrive when I gather the faithful of my Church to me in the clouds and when their departing shakes the entire world. It will literally shake the earth, and great shaking will consume Secret Babylon, and she will be rent up the middle as my saints depart. She will be utterly burned with fire from the sky as the missiles will fall. Her skirts will be covered with waters from the east and from the west! For a mighty angel will take up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all. For thus is it written and thus shall it be done!</p>
<p>For great is her judgment, and judgment has begun at the house of God. Her apostate churches will be destroyed, for I have judged them all that are not of me, even all the fake churches who speak great lies in hypocrisy. Mystery Babylon, oh, that you had turned to me, Jesus Christ, from your evil ways, for I would have saved you, and neither me nor Yahweh have any pleasure in the judgments that are about to be unleashed. But nevertheless, judgments will fall as pronounced, and that judgment will be severe and everlasting. For I had turned to the Gentiles for a season, and now I will turn away from the Gentiles and will turn to the flock of which I arose, even Israel. Though whosoever calls on the name of the Lord to the end will be saved, whether Judean or Gentile, for salvation is not bound by international borders.</p>
<p>Oh, Secret Babylon, your bridges will fall; your roads will be overturned, broken, and unpassable; your supply chains are already crumbling and will soon be desolate. No provisions will be delivered to you, for nobody will come to your aid, and you will be alone in your hour of desolation, oh, great harlot. You will have no happiness, and those who survive will find themselves fighting just to have a drink of water. Starvation will overtake the land. And great pestilence will overtake you, and even the animals will attack, for the times are here. The red armies that your treasonous government allowed into your borders will slay every man, woman, and child who does not fit their purposes. For they will kill and enslave all they find. They are the armies of the beast that have been gathered from the four corners of the earth for this purpose, and the concealed beast and concealed false prophet have gathered them.</p>
<p>They have no sympathy, no mercy, no grace, no remorse, and they utterly hate the inhabitants of Mystery Babylon for the awful sins your leaders have perpetrated on their lands. And all the while so many of you cheered on your unjust wars as you watched in amusement on your televisions, as you took great pleasure in the sins of your leaders. You have given your consent to your leaders whose sins you endorsed by vote, and so you will share in their judgment, for you have made yourselves worthy of a double portion of judgment, and it will overtake you suddenly.</p>
<p>And so my Bride will appear at my judgment seat, and some will suffer loss, some will carry away great reward, and all will receive fully of the down payment they have already received: For I will give them new, sinless bodies that will never corrupt! And so the seals will be loosed, for though tribulation and anguish have abounded on the earth for many years now, they are not the wrath of God nor the wrath of the lamb. So many of you foolishly think you have to endure the wrath of God, arrogantly thinking you are able to bear what is coming. Understand that I have saved my Church from wrath, for I came to my own and to the Gentiles during the age of grace as a peace treaty, offering peace and reconciliation to the Father of Lights, even El Shaddai! And those whom I have saved have by their free will accepted my unmerited favor, so follow their example!</p>
<p>So from the ashes of the horseman and out of great destruction will the beast and false prophet arise, for the mystery of iniquity is already at work. For Mystery Babylon is given into their hands and the confederation that is forming, even the ten horns will destroy her, for they are ten kings who give their all to the dragon, beast, and false prophet. For once the restrainer is removed, they will fully rise according to Scripture; for out of chaos rises their new order, even the order of the Dragon, for he is their power and authority, for so has been given him in a limited way for a very short time. The dragon has great wrath and will move in the spirit of Haman to make all things of Christ illegal, and anyone who is associated with my name, even Jesus Christ, will be hunted and killed. And those who love not their lives to the end will be saved and have great reward. So keep your mind and heart on the joy set before you, for in such manner I secured your salvation in the agonizing torment that was yours, except I willingly took your punishment and paid fully for the sins of mankind once and for all, even for all time.</p>
<div class="quotedlink jn-header"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro8">8</span><a href="/prophecy/behold-judgment-comes-and-the-times-are-now">Behold! Judgment Comes and the Times Are Now!</a><span>June 4, 2024</span></div>
<p>As the gathering together happens, the restrainer is removed, and great destruction will overtake the earth, suddenly and in an instant. For as the restrainer is removed, nothing will remain to hinder the evil in the world and the lusts and evil passions of mankind. Great war will break across the earth, and brother will once again rise to kill their brother, and great shall their destruction be. Many nations will fall as Mystery Babylon, even that great whore who sits on many waters, will be made desolate in one hour. That great city, even that nation of many United States, will be utterly destroyed; for she has earned a double portion of judgment, and she is worthy. For she lived deliciously in great sin; she sits in great arrogance thinking she can never fall and things will continue, yesterday as today, and tomorrow ever more the same and  unchanging. And the great whore has corrupted the earth with the golden cup in her hand, full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication. And so her judgment will fall suddenly. Great fire will overtake her cities as missiles fall; great shaking will occur, and that nation will split along the middle. Her coasts will be greatly flooded, and never will she rise again, for great are her sins and great is her judgment.</p>
<p>The coming world war will not last for years, because Satan knows that he has but a short time, yet war will be ever present during these times of trouble. Out of the ruins and horrors of war will rise the beast from the sea, and the beast from the earth, who is also the false prophet. These two will work in tandem, as they already work in tandem in secret for the destruction of Secret Babylon. And the ten horns, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate, and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. For God hath put in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled. (And so the horsemen will ride.)</p>

<p>Are you ready for me, my Bride? (For I am coming) Are you ready? Are you listening? Are you watching? For I am coming for you, so faint not and have great hope and expectation, for the very treasures of Heaven await my faithful and your reward is in my hand! But woe to all who have rejected me in faithless unbelief, even me, Jesus the Nazarene! And so the day of your judgment is upon you, oh, great harlot who sits upon many waters, and your appointed time has come. Sudden destruction is upon you and your enemies have readied themselves, yet you still live deliciously even though you are a nation in chains before me, Christ Jesus. Your time in the sun happened because for a season your Fathers followed the Son of God and kept my Words. But my Church age has come to a close because you traded the treasures of my mysteries, and even the well-being and love for my people have you merchandised for filthy lucre and acclaim before men.</p>
<p>You sold yourselves in base greed and dishonesty, and you have forsaken me, even Jesus Christ, who died for the sins of the world. But you have refused my word, you have refused my reproof, you have refused my council, you have refused my ambassadors, you have refused my prophets, you have refused my apostles, and you have refused me, Jesus the Nazarene, therefore you have refused Yahweh, and now I will refuse you, oh secret Babylon. And so judgment begins at the House of Yahweh!</p>
<p>For when you could have had peace and safety, you instead chose to blindly follow those who corrupted your nation. Even the Edomites tares who infest the lands, and who have troubled the earth since the evil one spread his abominations across Yahweh's creation.</p>
<p>So know, that I, even I Christ Jesus, will utterly consume Mystery Babylon with fire and in one hour will your destruction come, for it is written and what Yahweh has declared can no one change. Oh, foolish idolaters of the land of Secret Babylon, if only you understood your scenario. If only you would've inclined your ears to my words for I have called, begged, pleaded, exhorted, shouted, shown signs above and signs in the earth and instead of clothing your heart with sackcloth, instead of sitting in the ashes of repentance you instead are entertained as if you were watching magic tricks.</p>
<p>Woe to those who are entertained at the signs of Yahweh in the firmament that announce their judgment, and double woe to you Mystery Babylon, for you have a double portion of judgment that is about to be unleashed, and you will not escape nor recover. Secret Babylon you are a land of instant gratification, and you are most unwise. You have lured the nations in your ways of evil and compromise, and have made them drunk with the filthiness of your fornication. You do not understand my ways, for each among you walks in their own ways as they satanically do whatever they will, do what thou wilt is the whole of their satanic law and so the lawless come to nothing.</p>
<p>You do not understand my ways, for my ways are the ways of Yahweh, and I am the way the truth and the life, for no man comes to the Father except through me and if you have seen me you have seen the Father. But you have shut your minds, you have stopped your ears, you have hardened your hearts, and you have opened your mouths in blasphemous unbelief, even blaspheming the peace treaty that Yahweh has offered you. For I Jesus Christ, I am your peace!</p>
<p>But no, instead of making me Lord you instead use my holy name, even Jesus Christ, in vain as another word to express the filth in your own hearts. But you cannot profane my name, for Yahweh has given me a name above every name, that at the name of Jesus Christ should every knee bow both in heaven and earth. And you will pay for every idle word, and your times have come. And so now, since you have shut yourselves into your own dens thinking you can hide from Yahweh's judgment, I will now shut the door of entrance to the heavens for the unfaithful as I snatch my faithful away with me in the heavens for the bridegroom is approaching.</p>
<p>You foolishly think everything has gone back to normal, and the coming war can be watched on TV like the other wars your leaders unjustly waged. As you have been entertained by the death and destruction of other nations, so too will your nation be utterly destroyed, and your death and destruction will provide recompense to those destroyed with your consent. You foolishly think you can prepare for the wrath to come by living off the land, someplace off the grid, except you will be utterly decimated, captured, killed, hunted, starved, sickened, and many plagues will befall all those who reject me Yeshua HaMashiach, for to reject me is to reject the great eternal God, even Yahweh himself and there will be no remedy. So run to me now! You foolishly do not understand that the ten horns have colluded with the beast from the earth and the beast from the sea who have not yet risen to full power, and that your once great nation is fully given into their hands for utter destruction. (And with your nations utter destruction the beasts will rise!) For God has placed it in their hearts to fulfill his purposes.</p>
<p>You are utterly surrounded by your enemies vessels, you have allowed millions and millions of the Red Armies, even the army of the beast to infiltrate your lands. You have allowed them to commit acts of sabotage, they have destroyed your supply chains, they have destroyed your food supplies, they have destroyed your economy, they have made camps to cull, torture and execute anyone who does not suit their purposes. Understand that even then anyone who calls on my name, even Jesus Christ, to the end shall be saved. Those who make their choice of refusal final will eternally live with the consequences of faithlessness in the great flames prepared for the devil and his angels, for there is no other choice.</p>
<p>I counsel all who read these words to draw near to me. Quit your senseless debates and quit your senseless bickering amongst yourselves and preach the gospel of salvation as recorded in scripture and preach my word, even the words of my words in these last seconds. Preach them amongst yourselves, and be ever ready to help those in need. Quit judging your brothers and sisters and instead help each other in love to stand in the grace and mercy I have given, for it is sufficient. Confess and repent from your sins and do so now, you have no time! Make me, Jesus the Nazarene, your Lord, for time is up. Come to me now, for there are no other names given for salvation, except mine, Jesus Christ. Come to me now and depart from iniquity and I will receive you to myself if you but declare me Lord from a faith filled heart knowing that I am raised from the dead to die no more. I have outstretched my open arms to a dying world for many Jubilees now and times of grace and mercy are at a close, though grace and mercy are ever with me for I am a gracious Lord.</p>
<p>And so now, you wait in these final seconds, oh mystery Babylon. For suddenly will it happen. Suddenly will the fire fall, suddenly will the waters cover your skirts that are hiked above your waists, oh great harlot, suddenly violent shaking will come upon you and will tear you asunder, suddenly the command will be given and millions will break across the land to kill every and any living human that does not suit their purposes. They will have no mercy, they have no remorse, they cannot be pleaded with, they have no compassion, but they serve Satan and will fulfill the purposes given for them to fulfill, for they will fulfill the wrath of God on Mystery Babylon and never again will she rise.</p>
<p>Behold! The times are here. Repent while you still are able to draw air, for suddenly will it occur. Hear my words and understand: The restrainer is the only force keeping this evil at bay, and the time you think you have is simply time allowed to stage and move the pieces in place across the world's board and these times serve Yahweh's purposes. Then suddenly I will gather the faithful in my Church to meet me in the clouds and I will snatch my Bride away to her chambers, for in my Father's house are many mansions and I went to prepare a place for you my Bride and the heavens are readied for you!</p>
<p>And suddenly, when my Father's precious treasure is safely stored in the storehouse of the heavens (for it will happen in the twinkle of an eye) every yod and every thorn of a yod will come to pass, even every word that I have spoken by my true prophets and apostles, for they are many and the many that are of me speak in unison and speak according to my scriptures.</p>
<p>Understand this, those who refuse the plain Words in scripture concerning the gathering of my Church to meet me in the clouds, those same ones who deny will themselves be denied and take their place voluntarily in wrath when such a thing was not necessary, yet how many of you will stubbornly refuse my voice in favor of those who tickle your ears? Yet, so will it be.</p>
<div class="quotedlink bs-header"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro10">10</span><a href="/prophecy/hear-my-words-and-gather-yourselves-to-the-voice-of-your-lord">Hear My Words and Gather Yourselves to the Voice of Your Lord!</a><span>June 28, 2024</span></div>
<p>Behold! All world leaders work together behind the scenes, and they all serve Satan. You do not have elected leaders, but you are given a false choice because you never selected those you think you elect by vote, but they are presented to you for your vote that they may gain your consent and your consent is sin because you cannot willingly choose the lesser evil and stand for me at the same time, that is delusion.</p>
<p>Repent! Come out from among her and be ye separate! I, even the Lord Jesus Christ in the English tongue and Yeshua HaMashiach in Hebrew, have not provided a political solution and no world leader will arise for I have given none, and those who believe otherwise are sadly deceived. World leaders are all in collusion, and they will not break rank because your leaders all serve Satan either secretly, or openly. Do you still desire good words and fair speeches? Have you not been lied to enough, having lived lives of satanic deception since birth?</p>
<p>Why do you yet seek world leaders instead of me, Christ Jesus? For I am your Lord, King, Messiah, and High Priest that Yahweh has provided, and I have purchased the earth and even the lives of the redeemed in my atoning sinless blood. For as your High Priest, I gave myself as your sinless and perfect Passover lamb. And I am Lord of Lords and King of Kings, and I am coming as the Lion of the Tribe of Judah and will rule from the throne of David on earth and Yahweh's eternal purposes of salvation and redemption will be consummated in me when the Lion lies down with the lamb in my coming Kingdom and rule that has no end.</p>
<p>Behold! I tell you a thing before it happens. Secret Babylon, even these United States who once served as a beacon of light to the world, is in chains even reserved for fiery judgment. Her judgment and desolation will come suddenly and in one hour will she be burned with fire, in one hour will she be torn asunder, in one hour will her skirts be covered in water even from the east and even from the west. The red armies of the beast have already invaded her borders and are already staging and awaiting orders, and they will kill every man, woman, and child who does not serve their purposes. For the beast and false prophet who are about to be revealed already work in tandem for the destruction of secret Babylon, and they are already in her borders.</p>
<p>They are both former leaders of Secret Babylon. One appears that he is not and puppeteers an old senile stooge that is, and the other appears persecuted by the old stooge, and yet those of the land have proclaimed him their Cyrus and want him as their king, he claims he is the chosen one for the dragon has chosen him to deceive those of the land of promise, and he will build their temple, even when there is no need for such a thing for I Yeshua HaMashiach am the perfect Passover and you are the temple of the living God, even a temple made without men's hands but by the power of Yahweh for his glory and he will glorify you in me Christ Jesus your Lord!</p>
<p>Behold! These evil beasts and their forming alliance of ten horns already have coordinated Secret Babylons destruction. For they are ready worldwide, and they have prepared and staged worldwide for the final take down of the world as you know it and out of the ashes will rise their new order, out of chaos will rise their satanic order and the mark will be enforced to enter their society and God's people will live in the wilderness as in the days of Noah and relatively few will survive. For the beast and false prophet will make war with the saints and overcome them. These are they which will come out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore, are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his Temple: and he that sits on the Throne shall dwell among them.</p>
<p>They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore, neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them to living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. Behold! The enemy comes and the order of events follows: The restrainer will restrain until I gather the faithful in my Church to meet me in the clouds at my appearing for my Church, even my Bride. Though many of you deny plain scripture on this event, it will happen, and it will be known worldwide.</p>
<p>There is no secret rapture, for those are the words of Zionist false prophets and my appearing will be undeniable worldwide. They will seek to cover your departure with war and a fake alien invasion, but there are no aliens only fallen ones who pretend. When my Bride is taken into the heavens and the restrainer is removed sudden destruction will fall suddenly across the world and all nations that once pretended to be Christian will cease to exist in the manner they currently exist, yet there will be a remaining people that are conquered and culled. Mystery Babylon will fall first and suddenly at the same time as their surprise attack commences, but she will not ever rise ever again, for Yahweh has declared a double portion of judgment on her.</p>
<p>For Mystery Babylon has led the nations in great sin and deception through her witchcraft and sorceries even her so-called ritualistic entertainment and for her abominable sorceries passed for medicines that are in truth deadly poison. And so shall her end come suddenly and without remedy. And a wasteland will remain, though a remnant will be saved, for whosoever calls on the name of the Lord and loves not their lives to the end shall be saved. So understand the times you live and understand the coming order of events and understand that there is nothing that can change these events, for what Yahweh has declared can no one change!</p>
<p>Behold! I am Yeshua HaMashiach and I have sent these Words by my servant, and by my servant have these Words been sent. I will appear suddenly, are you ready my Bride?</p>
<div class="quotedlink bs-header"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro11">11</span><a href="/prophecy/why-do-you-grow-impatient">Why Do You Grow Impatient?</a><span>July 5, 2024</span></div>
<p>So stand fast for me in these final seconds of the age, and understand that time is up. Yes, time is up for Mystery Babylon to repent. My times of grace and mercy are up, though mercy and grace are forever with me. Now comes great judgment on the earth, and the nations and even the land. But judgment will not fall that eliminates all the living, but will fall and accumulate. Judgment upon judgment, seal after seal, trumpet upon trumpet, vial upon vial, woe upon woe, and plague upon plague. And as a result many, many, many people will come to salvation in me, Jesus the Nazarene, for I am the perfect Passover Lamb for all time, and there is no more need of sacrifice. But for you, my faithful Bride, the times of waiting are ended.</p>
<p>There will be no more delay, and no more wait, and you will come to your full reward and inheritance in me. And even though some will suffer loss, eye has not seen nor ear heard, nor entered into the heart of men, the things that Yahweh has prepared for those who love him. And so it is my faithful loves, you have shown your love for me, Christ Jesus, and your love for Yahweh because you obeyed my commandments by faith in this evil day. Even though you have not seen me with your own eyes, nor have you beheld Yahweh's eternal glory with your own eyes you have remained faithful in me to the end, therefore is there great reward treasured up for you in the heavens, so faint not!</p>
<div class="quotedlink bs-header"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro12">12</span><a href="/prophecy/the-rising-of-the-unholy-three">The Rising of The Unholy Three!</a><span>July 13, 2024</span></div>
<p>And so time is at an end and my appearing is approaching! I will now tell you the order of events that are soon to come to pass, so hearken yourselves to hear the voice of your Messiah, even Yeshua HaMashiach, even the words of the Lord of Lords, King of Kings, Messiah, and high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. Perhaps your national arrogance will blind your hearts to me, oh Mystery Babylon: even these United States. For you think you sit as a queen and no calamity will fall on you, and you say to yourselves, I am no widow! Yet your desolation will come within one hour and never again will you rise nor will your leadership ever plague Yahweh's earth again, for a double portion of judgment has been declared by Yahweh, and what Yahweh declares can no one change.</p>
<div class="quotedlink bs-header"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro13">13</span><a href="/prophecy/the-cry-of-the-innocents">The Cry of The Innocents!</a><span>July 23, 2024</span></div>
<p>And so I speak to you natural man, and I speak to you Secret Babylon. For you are guilty of the blood of the innocents, even those you have taken from the safety of their mother's womb. You have wrapped the smitings of the embryo in false justification and rationalization that make your selfish temptation to murder the innocents as common place as a doctor's visit, and your clinics of murder are a stench in my Father's nostrils, and a stench in my nostrils. For the blood of the innocents cries from the earth all the way to the throne of Yahweh in the heaven of heavens who sees all, even all you who seek to hide from his everlasting gaze. And I Yeshua HaMashiach am sent of my Father in judgment, and I am the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, for you have rejected the Lamb of God and now comes your judgment. And I will utterly cleanse the land of your murderous ways and you will eat of the filth of your own evil ways, for Yahweh has declared a double portion of judgment on you, oh Secret Babylon.</p>
<p>For you have murdered the innocents, ignorantly thinking that this heinous act is a light thing. You have sold your unborn children for filthy lucre that you may advance your careers, even your careers in utter futility for they will all come to naught and your highly prized worldly endeavors of futility will all vanish in judgment never to be remembered. For you have willingly murdered your unborn children in an unwitting sacrifice to Moloch, and you murder your own unborn with great pride. And so it will be, for pride goes before a fall and a haughty spirit before destruction and your judgment and destruction lingers not but is upon you and is already underway and the birth pangs are non-stop now.</p>
<p>But instead of repentance, instead of coming to me, Jesus the Nazarene in humility when I have offered you life eternal and remission of sins and the consequences stemming from corresponding judgment you have chosen instead your sins and own eternal punishment. You have committed yourselves to and chosen instead of me Jesus the Nazarene, Barabbas, your false Moshiach. Instead of Yahweh the great eternal God, you have chosen the dragon as your god and I will now give you over to them for you have joined their ways in your arrogance and pride and you will now eat of the filth of your own ways.</p>
<p>You have sacrificed the blood of the innocents on the altars of self gratification, and you shed your smitten embryos as if they were impure rags tossed aside into medical waste bins, and you have accounted the spirit of life that is in the blood an unholy thing and your judgment is on you. But your very own, even your unborn children, were out of style with your ever fading fashions and their lives were a hindrance to you fully enveloping yourselves in the pleasures of sins.</p>
<p>You justify and demand the blood of the innocents in your murderous political ideologies, and you knowingly have joined the fallen ones in their rebellion, for it was the Satans who taught the smitings of the embryo in the womb, even your precious murderous procedures you are so proud to protect and flaunt. And so the blood of the innocents cries from the earth and the weight of your sins have caused the earth to wobble like a drunken man, and great will be the shaking and great will be the fall! Babylon the Great is Fallen is Fallen!</p>
<p>Oh natural man, Oh Secret Babylon, how you have fallen from the grace and mercy that I undeservedly bestowed on you. And though my grace and mercy is not in vain, for Yahweh's purposes, even his purposes hidden in the great mystery of God have been fulfilled in the Gentile nations and their times are completed. And I am he who will now turn to save Jacob from destruction, for they will turn to me as their Messiah, even all that Yahweh himself has called from eternities past to walk before him as one new man in me Christ Jesus, and one new nation and never again will the Israel of God be divided and there will be no more sea. But first the lands must be cleansed and Satan's kingdom will be utterly destroyed, never to rise again. Oh foolish, evil and corrupted natural man, even you who has not my spirit and he who has rejected life eternal in me Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>Understand that children are the Lord's heritage, and it would be better for a person to never be born than to harm the innocent ones before their first breath; to harm even one of my little ones is grievous and carries eternal punishment. But nevertheless you continue. Even though I have inspired many to stand outside your clinics to try and stop you from sealing your own fates. But you would have none of it, and you have rejected my warnings and now will suffer your judgment.</p>
<div class="quotedlink bs-header"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro14">14</span><a href="/prophecy/reject-the-mark-of-the-beast">Reject The Mark of the Beast!</a><span>July 27, 2024</span></div>
<p>Behold! I speak of the times of Jacobs trouble that is ready to break across the entire earth. For judgment is already underway and cannot be stopped, for what Yahweh declares can no one change! Many, many tears have I cried over Mystery Babylon's judgment and I have sent my prophets for many, many years now and have even sent strangers from strange lands to witness and prophecy of the judgments that were approaching but are now here.</p>
<p>For so it will be for so it is written: The ten horns which you saw upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate, and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. For God has put in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled. And the woman, which thou saw, is that great city which reigns over the kings of the earth. Hear my words, Secret Babylon's judgment is already underway. The ten horns have prepared their surprise attack and their attack approaches and is at your door. For even your media seeks to soothe you to sleep and many sit in darkness blind to reality saying: I sit as a Queen and am no widow and will see no mourning.</p>
<p>Tomorrow will be as today, for today is as yesterday. In as much as she glorifies herself, and lives in pleasure, so much give to her torment and sorrow: Therefore shall her plagues come at one day, death, and sorrow, and famine, and she shall be burnt with fire: for Yahweh who condemns her, is the Almighty God and there is none greater and there is nothing that can stop El Shaddai's mighty hand!</p>
<p>And so the sun will soon rise on a day of calamity you do not expect, and that day is nearer than you imagine. And that day will bring utter destruction on Mystery Babylon, for she has a double portion of judgment declared against her. Her crimes and fornication are many and her penalty lingers not and great punishment will fall on the unrepentant even as my faithful Church and even my faithful Bride will be gathered to me suddenly in the clouds and saved from wrath, even the great trouble of Daniel's seventieth week. Babylon the Great is Fallen, is Fallen! Hear my words for I speak as if it is already happened for nothing will change, slow, hinder, nor stop Yahweh's judgments from crashing onto the earth. In one hour she will be burned with fire, some of her cities will burn, some of her cities will be violently flooded, her towers will fall and break in many pieces, her bridges will fall, and much shaking will occur. The earth will be torn asunder violently and much land will be covered over in violent waters. Her skirts will be covered from the east and from the west in great waves and up the middle rushing waves and violent shaking. Of what remains will be a wasteland and never again will she rise, for this nation of many states and many cities shall never rise again and great will be her fall! For the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof, and all aspects of her evil influence will forever be erased from the nations during Daniel's seventieth week, for so I will cleanse the earth in my wrath. I, Christ Jesus, the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, have declared these words, and preparation for their fulfillment is already underway and will suddenly be fulfilled in one hour.</p>
<p>And so war will break across the earth as part of the surprise attack on Secret Babylon, for this is planned and coordinated for many jubilees now, for the mystery of iniquity has been at work since the days of old and will reach full consummation once the restrainer is removed as my faithful are taken into the heavens. War will fall across the earth and will come onto all peoples and all nations, for this is the third such war, as the fallen ones seek to destroy the old orders of the world and replace all things with their new order, even the order of the Dragon. The beast from the sea and the beast from the earth will rise in great fury, and they will make war with the saints, for it is given to them to overcome the saints. So it will be that all who love not their lives and call on the name of the Lord till the end shall be saved into everlasting joy into the eternity of eternities. And I Jesus the Nazarene have left an eternal example of obedience unto death, for my obedience to Yahweh was even the death of the cross as I suffered and paid for the sins of mankind as the lamb of God and behold I am coming as the Lion of the Tribe of Judah and I will not be stopped nor hindered!</p>
<p>You have gone astray into the ways of Baal and you have become just as Satan has led you, for you are beyond all feeling in your nihilistic ways. Do what you will is the whole of their law that you have made your very own. You have been led astray into the ways of the Canaanite, for they sacrificed their children as well, with great pride and joy, just as you continue to do! But in your arrogance you think you are nothing like those foolish and unlearned ancients and your ways are superior to these ancient barbarians, yet you practice the same. But you foolishly think you are different, and you seek to use willing ignorance as a cloak, and you seek to rationalize and hide your sins in your spurious educations that have led you to judgment. For the weight of the innocent blood cries to the heavens even now and demands justice, and Yahweh has heard their cries!</p>
<p>You have unknowingly given your unborn to further the beast system, and the fallen ones have accepted your sacrifices. They have used the blood of the innocents as they always have in the making of their abominations, and so in the days of Noah so will it be. For when the restrainer is removed, then you will understand the sheer enormity and number of their abominations, for they will be released completely unrestrained.</p>
<p>You have sacrificed the blood of the innocents and the abominations they have made will hound you and pursue you to the ends of the earth for they have always eaten the inhabitants of the land and the evil tares made by the hands of the fallen ones have no forgiveness for their sins and crimes against Yahweh, for mankind is made in the image of Yahweh and to desecrate the life of the flesh that is in the blood is grave sin and will not be overlooked for those who have refused my salvation during my times of grace and mercy. Behold! I send giants to fulfill my wrath!</p>
<div class="quotedlink bs-header"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro15">15</span><a href="/prophecy/take-up-a-lamentation-for-secret-babylon">Take Up a Lamentation for Secret Babylon!</a><span>August 3, 2024</span></div>
<p>Behold! Secret Babylon sits in chains as the ten horns finalize their preparations for her utter destruction. Truly, truly, to Secret Babylon and for many jubilees now have I sent my apostles, have I sent my prophets, have I sent my evangelists, have I sent my pastors, have I sent my teachers, have I sent my faithful disciples and brethren and I have even sent the widows in their solitude, and I have utterly poured out my spirit to the uttermost in these last days of grace and mercy!</p>
<p>But instead of the nations sitting in sack cloth and ashes they are entertained by the signs and warnings given of impending judgment as they take pictures and videos for their entertainment. They have rejected my messengers who brought the light of my gospel of salvation, they have mocked and ridiculed my prophets, they have attacked my evangelists, they have corrupted my pastors, and persecuted and compromised my teachers.</p>
<p>The armies of the great red dragon do surround you secret Babylon and are fully within your borders. For even your traitorous Zionist leaders have sold you for a morsel of bread to your enemies and also to advance their satanic schemes. And El Shaddai has allowed these madmen to continue, even putting it into their hearts to fulfill his purposes. Strong is El Shaddai who judges you, oh scarlet whore who sits arrogantly in pleasure even as you are stripped of all glory, stripped of all delicacies, stripped even of your homes for I have given your homes and lands into the hands of your enemies. Even into the hands of the beast and the false prophet, for they work hand in hand for your utter destruction behind the facade of an old stooge.</p>
<p>For the beast is about to cast down the great harlot of which the beast has grown tired of carrying, and her purposes have been served. Therefore, she will be utterly burned, and utterly destroyed in one hour and her destruction lingers not. For their lines of war, even their red lines given disingenuously to not cross, have been laid down and crossed repeatedly and purposefully. Do not believe their lies, nor their false justifications because they seek to appear righteous in their coming war and the beast and false prophet who have not yet fully risen will rise fully and claim that God's judgment fell to serve their purposes, so believe not even one of the least of their lies and their final judgment lingers not.</p>
<p>For they will continue and even commit worse sins than Secret Babylon, and they are culpable in leading Secret Babylon fully astray and to her utter destruction, for God has put it in their hearts to accomplish his will. They work in collusion and all those who appear as enemies work together in secret as they play along according to their script and act their parts on the world stage, and they will assassinate all those in their orders who choose not to rehearse and perform their parts adequately to fulfill the purposes of the dragon.</p>
<p>For the dragon gives the beasts his power and his throne, and great authority, And the ten horns receive power as kings one hour with the beast and these have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast for so is given them by Yahweh for them to accomplish. Pay attention my children and learn of me and follow my ways, for my ways are the ways of Yahweh, the great eternal God!</p>
<p>Understand and pay attention, for these treasonous beasts and evil kings are of the orders of the Dragon and have ruled Secret Babylon from their secret societies since her beginning. The man who dissembles and pretends, even the wicked man, walks with a perverse mouth. Yes they pretend to be others for they are all pretenders, and hidden amongst all nations the tares have been sown. They make signs with their eyes: they signify with their feet: they instruct with their fingers. Lewd things are in their hearts: they imagine evil at all times, and raise up contentions. Therefore, shall their destruction come speedily: they shall be destroyed suddenly without recovery. These six things does the Lord hate: yea, his soul abhors seven: The haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that imagines wicked enterprises, feet that be swift in running to mischief, A false witness that speaks lies, and him that raises up contentions amongst brethren.</p>
<p>Are you blind? Do you refuse to recognize their symbols so you can continue to sit in willful ignorance that your leaders are of the fallen ones? Do you not understand that your entertainers are of the fallen ones? Do you not realize that they are not of the same nature as you, for many have forever altered themselves in their insanity and some are tares from birth and the Devil is their Father? Yet you choose to willingly sit in darkness, and revel and bask in your sins as you roll in the mire with the pigs who have led you to the very gates of hell where many ignorantly parade themselves in vanity and pride. Wherefore I have stated in my letter to Ephesus given to Paul: Awake you who sleeps, and stand up from death, and I, Christ Jesus, shall give you light! Take heed therefore that ye walk circumspectly: not as fools, but as wise. And so I expose these evil leaders of Secret Babylon to my called chosen and faithful that you do not fall victim to their deception and that you may fully come out of her and be separate in all of your ways and that you share not in her plagues.</p>
<p>Hear my words and understand what is happening right now, for their surprise attack is underway. I speak now to Secret Babylon though she is deaf, dumb, and blind and utterly bound in chains for her judgment. As they have prepared their surprise attack for many years now, and they have secured Secret Babylons destruction through usury, and other deceptive means, because even her monetary notes are nothing but an empty promise of debts incurred at the hands of your leaders who serve the money changers and secret Babylon is sold into the hands of their enemies by these crafty means. Do you not understand fractional reserve banking and fiat currency? Study to learn.</p>
<p>Did I not give you an example when I chased the money changers out of the temple? Yet, instead of throwing them out, you invite them in to have supper with your families, and you have pledged your children and your grandchildren as collateral to fulfill your greedy lusts and so your posterity has been merchandised to secure your destruction so you could live the pleasures of sin. You, Secret Babylon, do murder your unborn in great happiness and pride and murderers of the innocents have their appointed judgment and your judgment lingers not. Though a few remaining stragglers are running up the ramp into the Ark before El Shaddai closes the door, most will find themselves left to judgment  because they will choose instead to remain outside mocking and living deliciously.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in one hour will her destruction fall suddenly and they will not escape. Since she has given herself in service to her eternal enemies they will now bring about her eternal destruction for never again will Secret Babylon rise. Oh Secret Babylon, since you have sold your children as surety in pledge for your debts so you could continue in the pleasures of sin (for even your money is usury), since you have murdered the innocents, and much more have you done. I will now give you fully into their hands and Yahweh has even declared a double portion of judgment on you secret Babylon. And many of your children will be sent to their work and reeducation camps and many will be taken to foreign lands for the dragon is allowed claim on the lands and the people who have rejected me, Yeshua HaMashiach, in favor of Barabbas their false Messiah. And many will take their beastly mark and have sold their souls and their posterity to eternal punishment from the presence of the everlasting and eternal God for the pleasures of sin for a short season.</p>
<p>Take up a lamentation for the people of Secret Babylon, even you who sit in darkness and utter ignorance of your own coming destruction. In front of your very own eyes and by consent of your vote and by means of your slothful apathy, your entire nation has been dismantled in front of your very eyes. You no longer have the ability or resources to fight a war, for I, even Christ Jesus, have stripped your military might and given it into the hands of your enemies. Your once great cities now sit in ruins of crime and poverty, of which your entertainers and you both boast in great pride. The Edomites have long since removed their factories from your lands, and you lack the manufacturing power you once had and even the raw materials to produce what you need to fight your never-ending wars.</p>
<p>For you go from war to war, and you have utterly decimated the lands, both foreign and domestic. For from you, Secret Babylon, has gone forth the scourge of the Red Armies, even spreading world wide the red leaven of the great red Dragon, for you have served the fallen ones secretly since the beginning and continue to this day. Secret Babylon, you willingly give your consent to your Satanic rulers, who know full well their plans and know full well they are in the process of fully destroying your once great nation and you. For you are guilty of the blood of the saints, and the blood of the martyrs cries from the earth for your judgment and if Yahweh were not to judge you he would have to repent to the nations he has taken in judgment in times past, even those who serve as a warning of your own impending judgment that you blatantly ignore.</p>
<p>From you, Secret Babylon, came the destruction brought on foreign lands by the Red Armies as the Edomites ingratiated themselves to the working class with their poisonous leaven, even their blasphemous manifesto financed by the Red Shield. For the robber barons of times past, even your captains of industry of previous generations, (even those to whom you have sold your posterity) are the ones responsible for the scourge of the red armies. Secret Babylon with her web of debt has financed and sponsored the Red Armies in their endeavors from the beginning, and Secret Babylon has been part of their network from the beginning as the Red Shield established itself worldwide. Even the fiery dragon's breath that has come from the Red Shield, for they are the fallen ones who walk among you.</p>
<p>From secret Babylon were their “revolutionary” leaders trained in secret for she sits on many waters, and they were sent secretly into foreign lands, even into Gog and Magog and their revolutions were great, and violent, and cruel and they now cover the earth. They spread their satanic leaven across the lands of the east and utterly consumed all in their paths. They went forth from Secret Babylon and have been a scourge on the earth, and all the while secret Babylon has lied and the great whore has claimed to speak for me and called herself Christian. This violent overthrow of the old order has gone across the earth and now moves to its final stage, and they will be permitted their system, but only to serve the eternal purposes of Yahweh, for in truth the fallen ones do tremble and fear grips their vile hearts for they know their long coming judgment is upon them. For you Secret Babylon in your fornication and whoredoms, you sleep with the enemy.</p>
<p>Behold! The great whore, even Secret Babylon a nation of many states, is that woman showed to John the Revelator, even that woman drunken with the blood of the Saints, and with the blood of my Martyrs and your judgment is upon you. For in such manner, you have lived deliciously while your leaders destroyed other nations with your consent and with your money you are as guilty as these Edomite tares you have sold your posterity for the pleasures of sin. You financed and supported and secretly coordinated the overthrow of many nations! And all nations who have been overthrown by the red armies with the backing of the Red Shield have been culled and persecuted and tortured and starved and murdered in the most grievous manner. The saints who were in these lands you have martyred even untold millions. And all the while you danced and used Satans sorceries in celebration thinking it will never come to you, even the drugs given you for your deaths. Secret Babylon, you have sacrificed an entire generation of children who are now military aged men who could have defended you but instead now live on the streets of your disgusting cities and are hopelessly addicted to these sorceries and they have become zombies of the walking dead as these drugs rot their flesh even while they are still alive.</p>
<p>Now comes your judgment in full Secret Babylon and you are a spectacle for all to see, yet you continue in ignorance and blindness saying in your hearts that calamity will never come on you, even though you have cheered as your leaders brought calamity to the shores of countless nations in their unjust wars of which you were entertained as you watched on television. And so you have been divided amongst your enemies and they already enjoy the spoils of war even before the missiles have fallen. For Secret Babylons defeat is guaranteed and given by Yahweh himself and nothing will stop her utter ruin and never again will she rise.</p>
<div class="quotedlink bs-header"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro16">16</span><a href="/prophecy/suddenly-is-your-hope-revealed">Suddenly is Your Hope Revealed!</a><span>August 9, 2024</span></div>
<p>So understand that the time remaining is inconsequential and only serves Yahweh's purposes before judgment falls suddenly. Yes, the enemy is given the chance to stage for his attack on Secret Babylon for so is given of him by Yahweh to accomplish. But understand fully that Satan is a defeated enemy who is bound to the earth for judgment and he is only allowed to further the purposes of Yahweh and he will sit in silence and wait for the restrainer to be removed and he can literally do nothing more than he is allowed, so fear not the roar of that toothless lion for the little prince is bound in defeat! For of a truth, the fallen ones fear you and they understand and know that those they once victimized will be the ones who bring judgment and righteous punishment into their own bosoms eternally and forevermore. What? Know you not that you will judge angels?</p>
<p>Understand that time is up and nothing can turn back the events that are coming and are lining themselves up against the dwellers of the earth, for great is the coming judgment of sinners. And so I ask and constrain you by the very same compassion, grace and mercy Yahweh has shown you in the face of Jesus Christ for your salvation. Can you remain faithful to the end? Will you allow yourselves to enter into my eternal rest without quitting at the last minute? Will you focus your full heart and attention on my words and understand that suddenly it will forever change and suddenly is now.</p>
<p>There is no time remaining for Secret Babylon to repent and there is no more time in my age of grace and mercy for time is up. And to every season there is a time and a purpose and in the consummation of times will sudden redemption fall on the redeemed so let the redeemed of the earth say so whom he has ransomed from the hand of the enemy. And do not allow the thief to steal your joy for what bride mourns the day of her wedding, even a glorious, holy wedding day of which none can corrupt nor trouble.</p>
<div class="quotedlink bs-header"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro17">17</span><a href="/prophecy/babylon-the-great-is-fallen">Babylon the Great Is Fallen, Is Fallen!</a><span>August 18, 2024</span></div>
<p>So I tell all who will hear of events that will happen before they happen. These events are not secret but have been heralded by my prophets and servants for many years now, even all those whom I have sent to Secret Babylon. For the times of Judgment of that great whore are here, and the beast who carries her will now destroy her utterly. For God has put it into the hearts of the ten horns to fulfill his will, and they hate the whore, and will continue to make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and continue to burn her with fire. And so will secret Babylon be made utterly desolate and laid bare in shame for all to see. </p>
<p>Her once great cities that were examples of hard work and production and the abundance of El Shaddai now sit in ruins with her posterity addicted to drugs and living in filth on her disgusting streets. And she is made naked as her defenses are off shored even further and her wealth and strength is given into the hands of her Edomite enemies who pretend they are allies. The great whore who made war with all nations she was sent to conquer is now bound, and defenseless and ready to be fully conquered. And all flesh will be consumed in misery and all who are captured will be culled and those who are able to serve the beast's purposes will be carried away into slavery and the rest will be killed, though a remnant will survive. And she is ablaze and there are many fires already in her borders and in the lands of her neighbors to the north who share in her plagues. And yet these are just the birth pangs and are not the final judgments but a warning to all of their impending destruction.</p>
<p>For suddenly will it happen, and suddenly will it occur. It will occur only and even as I snatch my faithful from the earth to safety and I will suddenly gather Yahweh's wheat into his everlasting barn, for the times of harvest are here. Yet not the final harvest, but the first of several, and so judgment begins at the house of God.</p>
<p>Secret Babylon, your times have come, and your days are at an end. I, Jesus the Nazarene, have shed countless tears over your impending destruction and I have sent signs above, and wonders in the skies, and signs in the earth and even many sudden cataclysms occur in real time and in her midst and still Secret Babylon stops her ears in stubborn rebellion, and now she will fully eat of her rebellious ways. So understand, that as I suddenly gather the faithful to safety and reward, so too will sudden destruction fall on mystery Babylon as the restrainer is fully removed. Hear my words and understand my voice because the restrainer is the only thing keeping the destructive lusts of the fallen ones restrained until he who restrains no longer restrains and is taken from the midst.</p>
<p>Then shall sudden destruction come upon the entire world. The battle lines are drawn, and they have prepared for their third world war, even their war to fully overturn the ways of old and the orders of old. And so fire will fall suddenly on Secret Babylon and her cities will be destroyed. Fire will fall suddenly as the missiles crash across her lands, leaving her burnt and naked. Yet many of her cities along her sinful coasts will fall to the waters that will come suddenly and will crash on her shores flooding inland for many, many miles and this will happen from the east and from the west. The earth will suddenly quake uncontrollably, and great destruction will come on the lands of secret Babylon, and the lands will be disfigured and altered. Her bridges will fall, and her roads will become impassable, and a wilderness and a wasteland will remain. The stench of death will cover her lands and pestilence and disease will fill her lands and utterly helpless will she be.</p>
<p>And as this final attack takes place, the hordes of the Red Army will be fully unleashed on the remaining inhabitants of the land. They will kill all who resist and will kill many who do not resist. For the people of secret Babylon are sold into slavery by the mountainous debts she has incurred, for by usury the fallen ones work to destroy the masses. And in so much as her people have pledged and signed their lives away for material gain and the pleasures of sin, so too will those whom they choose to enslave serve those they are indebted in forced labor and the mark will be enforced for all who survive, only take not the mark.</p>
<p>And so the world that now is, will be suddenly replaced with the ashes of ruins and smoldering remains of a once vibrant society. And so famine will descend on the lands, for Secret Babylon has caused famine on many lands and now famine will be her dinner guest, for so she has given and so doubly she will now receive. Water will be a sought after commodity, and many waters will be made bitter from the destruction and fires of war and from the plagues of the unburied that will pollute the land. And many will needlessly suffer and perish in judgment for their sins, when such a thing was not necessary for them but those who remain amongst the judged will themselves be judged, yet any and all who call on the name of their Lord until the end shall be saved, but they will have to endure until their last breath. For faithfulness to the end has always been a requirement for the faithful, even Yahweh's very own children of Abraham who are the children of promise, for the just shall live by faith.</p>
<p>And so will secret Babylon be utterly split along the middle and the waters will rush where there was once fertile dry land, even the heart lands will be flooded up the center. And so God's mercy and grace will be utterly removed from the earth when the restrainer is suddenly removed and destruction will marry destruction, for these are the times of destruction where Satan's kingdom will be fully judged and fully destroyed, but first they will serve Yahweh's purposes in utterly consuming mystery Babylon and so will she be utterly burnt and consumed in many raging fires that will engulf and begin to cleanse the land.</p>
<p>And so Secret Babylon's destruction will come to pass in one hour, for as it is written so shall it be done, and she will receive a double portion of judgment. And as it is written, so shall it be done. For it is written of old by John the Revelator: I saw another Angel come down from heaven, having great power, so that the earth was lightened with his glory, And he cried out mightily with a loud voice, saying, It is fallen, it is fallen, Babylon that great city, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of all foul spirits, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the Kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are grown rich of the abundance of her pleasures.</p>
<p>And I heard another voice from heaven say, come out of her, my people, that you be not partakers of her sins, and that you receive not of her plagues. For her sins are come up into heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities. Reward her, even as she has rewarded you, and give her double according to her works: and in the cup that she has filled for you, fill hers double. In as much as she glorified herself, and lived in pleasure, so much give you to her torment and sorrow: for she says in her heart, I sit being a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no mourning. Therefore, shall her plagues come at one day, death, and sorrow, and famine, and she shall be burnt with fire: for God which condemns her, is a strong Lord!</p>
<p>And so this once great nation of states and many cites will fall suddenly, and the angel of destruction currently hovers over her greatest and largest city on the eastern waters and her pride and joy and envy of the world will be utterly destroyed never to rise again. And so too will her destruction be shared by all those who have joined her, for she is that great whore who sits on many waters that are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.</p>
<p>For their judgment lingers not, and all the kings of the earth have joined the ten horns in their surprise attack. For their leaders willingly serve the fallen ones, for so are all worldly rulers. There are none good, no, not one. These leaders have worked for many years to bring this attack to pass and have betrayed their own nations of which they were sent to deceive. And the people who willingly followed them in pleasure will fall to the fires of war, pestilence, death and destruction. And these things are at the ready to be suddenly released fully on the earth. And so all so-called Christian nations will fall by the sword as judgment begins at the house of God. And as it was in the days of old when Israel left the Father of Lights and served other gods, who by nature are no gods, so too will these be given into the hands of their enemies, even as the twelve tribes were divided and conquered of old for their betrayal of covenants and brought about by the curse of the law for the disobedient and hard-hearted.</p>
<div class="quotedlink bs-header"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro18">18</span><a href="/prophecy/911-emergency-alert">911 Emergency Alert!</a><span>August 31, 2024</span></div>
<p>Natural man, you go from sin to sin in your filthy sinful ways, and although I have showered the earth in my grace and mercy so that you may escape your impending judgment, you instead have chosen to bear your judgment and calamity, and so shall it be. And so now judgment begins with the house of God, and so will it be. Secret Babylon, even that great nation of United States, now stands chained, naked, and destitute and awaits her final destruction.</p>
<p>Because of her sins, fornications, adulteries, abominations, and utter filth and depravity with which she has corrupted the earth, she will now face her destruction. And the great harlot is now given fully into the hands of her enemies, yet the restrainer restrains until there is a restrainer to restrain no more, and suddenly will the restrainer be removed at the great gathering together of my saints! And at which time the restrainer is removed, they will execute their secret attack that they have planned and coordinated for many years now, for so is given into their hands to accomplish, and Secret Babylon will utterly be destroyed in one hour.</p>
<p>And the ten horns will destroy the great harlot because they hate the whore, and they shall make her desolate and naked and will eat her flesh and will burn her with fire. And great shaking will come on the earth, and she will be split, and the waters will cover her coasts, and the waters will cover her heart, and she will be divided asunder. For so it is written: her sins are come up into heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities. Reward her, even as she has rewarded you, and give her double according to her works: and in the cup that she has filled to you, you fill her double. Inasmuch as she glorified herself and lived in pleasure, so much give you to her torment and sorrow: for she says in her heart, I sit being a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no mourning. Therefore, shall her plagues come at one day, death, and sorrow, and famine, and she shall be burnt with fire: for that God which condemns her, is a strong Lord. Then a mighty Angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, With such violence shall that great city Babylon be cast, and shall be found no more.</p>
<p>And so will it be that this once great nation, of which I have redeemed many, will now be taken in judgment, even as my Church and my Bride are taken into the heavens, where I have prepared for them a place of safety and refuge where they will receive their inheritance. And never again shall Secret Babylon be, and her greatest city that arrogantly sits as though nothing will ever change will fall completely along with her, never to rise again.</p>
<p>Truly, truly, all of her sinful and disgusting cities will fall, and her towers will tumble, and great fires and destruction will make her roads impassable. Then will the red armies, even the armies of the beast that he has imported for her destruction, be unleashed on what remains, and they will consume her flesh. And so it will be that whosoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved. Yet, those that remain are sold into slavery by usury because the leaders of Secret Babylon have betrayed her citizens and have given them as collateral, and payment is now due.</p>
<p>Understand what has happened, my people, and remember my words. The mangy shepherds have worked together for her destruction; the one mangy shepherd who rules in secret puppeteers the old stooge, while the other mangy shepherd who appears persecuted by the old stooge works hand in hand with the mangy shepherd who rules in secret. For they pretend they are enemies at the present time, but they are all from the same mangy flock, fulfilling the dragon's purposes, and so I told my Church, my Body, and even my Bride! And so the mangy shepherds have delivered Secret Babylon into the hands of her enemies, for so they are sent. They have made the whore naked, for so was given them to accomplish, for even the enemies of Yahweh obey his voice. Understand they have purposely left her military might in foreign lands and given her secrets to the ten horns so they may rule in strength. It is the ten horns who will give their power to the beast, for so is given them to accomplish.</p>
<p>The great whore has fought endless and futile wars designed to wear down her strength. Secret Babylon has by design instigated war with the Bear in order to grind down her strength and might so that she is now left naked and defenseless, and into the red dragon's hands is she now given as spoil. And every facet of her empire that sits on many waters will likewise be given as spoil into their hands. Understand that they are at the ready and will move suddenly to execute in unison their worldwide attack, and on all fronts will they attack in swift destruction, and a very short victory will they have before judgment falls in great wrath on the earth.</p>
<p>I counsel all who hear these words to listen fully to my instruction and understand that now is the time and suddenly will fulfillment fully come. I require the full hearts of my faithful, so continue to purify yourselves in my atoning blood and confess your sins to me so that I may fully purify you in my atoning blood. Do not be fooled by your senses, because Secret Babylon is blind and deaf and willingly ignorant of her impending judgment, which is already underway and cannot be stopped. Therefore, share not in her blindness that you suffer not of her plagues, and be separate from among them so you are fully ready for the appearing of your everlasting Lord. Behold, my Bride! The Bridegroom approaches, so keep your lamps filled, wicks trimmed and lit, in earnest expectation of your approaching Lord, for now are the times of gathering, and the times of gathering are now.</p>
<p>Hear me, and hear me well; war is here, and Secret Babylon is chained for destruction; and her judgment and punishment lingers not but is imminent. And as I snatch my Church, my Body, and even my Bride away from calamity into the safety of the heavens, the restrainer will be removed, and they will have their surprise attack, and the time of their attack is now. The ten kings have colluded among themselves, and they have surely set their hands to the ready; they have staged, they have prepared, and they have covered the earth in their lies, that they may seem justified in the genocide of millions and millions that will fall to the tragedy and pains of their war.</p>
<div class="quotedlink bs-header"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro19">19</span><a href="/prophecy/as-it-is-written-so-shall-it-be-done">As it is Written, So Shall it Be Done!</a><span>September 7, 2024</span></div>
<p>At the times of the gathering of the saints, the restrainer will be removed, and judgment will fall fully on the house of God. And those who have allowed me to refine them in the refiner's fire will stand because they have been purified in the blood of the lamb and will stand in the righteousness that I have given them, because I am the Righteous Lord who is a life-giving spirit. And those who refused my voice and remained stubborn to my will and refused to come out of sin into righteousness will be left to further refining during the times of Jacob's trouble, and many multitudes will achieve eternal salvation, reward, and splendor, and forever they will live and great glory is theirs forevermore. And so also will the remaining counterfeit churches be destroyed as the Dragon, the beast from the sea, and the beast from the earth will move swiftly to make war on the remaining saints and will overcome them. And so will it be.</p>
<p>When the restrainer is removed, Secret Babylon will be destroyed as written. Even in one hour will her fate become final, and great misery and destruction will consume the earth, and great shaking will occur, and it will be plain to the world that the day of the Lord has come, though the fallen ones will lie and present themselves as benevolent aliens, and they will endeavor to cover my appearing for the faithful in war and a fake alien invasion. So do not believe their lies, my children, for their lies are intended to lead you to eternal destruction that is reserved for the fallen ones, so join them not.</p>
<p>And so the seals will be loosed and the four horseman will be released on the world, and many, many people will perish as a result. And of Secret Babylon's empire that sits on many waters, even these will be destroyed and culled, and the spoils will serve the rising and final beast system; and it is final because I, Christ Jesus, will utterly destroy and ruin Satan's kingdom, never to rise again. And so the world will wonder after the beast, and many will join their satanic kingdom. And the evil nature in mankind, brought about by Adam's sin when Eve took from the serpent and did eat, will be utterly unrestrained, and mankind will have full madness in their hearts, and many will forever join themselves to the beast by accepting and taking the mark of the beast. Take not his mark, because all who do will forever be cast alive into that fiery lake of brimstone, burning the hottest flames of blue.</p>

<p>Therefore, understand my little ones, that judgment has come on the earth, even that great judgment foretold of old by the prophets of old even whose time for fulfillment has now come. The birth pangs are non-stop on the earth now as judgment is here and my redeemed will come to their full redemption. And so it is that events will come, wave by wave. Each wave greater and more intense in its destruction than the last until suddenly you are taken to safety and suddenly Secret Babylon is not. Each wave brings judgment and each wave crashes harder and louder than the last. And so are my judgments and warnings to the earth, for I do come as the lion of the tribe of Judah and in righteousness I do come to judge and make war.</p>
<p>And so it is that before the final calamity strikes it will happen at my command that my faithful ones who have fallen asleep in Christ will be raised from their graves and my faithful ones who are alive and remain will be gathered with them and into the heaven of the heavens you will go, where you will all stand before that great judgment-seat of Christ that you all may receive for the things done in the body. All who are taken to approach my Bema do not come there to be judged on account of their sins because you accepted remission of sins during the day of sinful man even in this day when sinful man rules the earth of which rule is at its end. Because the earth belongs to me, Christ Jesus, and the fullness thereof, and I am approaching and I will take by force my inheritance from the squatters and their full judgment lingers not.</p>
<p>My loves, understand that you have passed from death straight to eternal life in me, Christ Jesus your Lord. And I am he who has cleansed you fully from sin in my atoning blood because I am your perfect Passover who has offered myself to Yahweh the great eternal God, once, all, and forevermore for the sins of mankind: therefore, there remains no more sacrifice for sins.</p>
<p>Therefore, the sons of God will approach my judgment seat that I may judge their works so that all will receive for what they have accomplished, whether it be good or bad. And so you all will bring the sacrifices of your redeemed lives on earth you have offered in service to your eternal Lord. As it is written, so will it be done, just as written: For other foundation can no man lay, then that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. And if any man build on this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, timber, hay, or stubble, Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by the fire: and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is. If any man's work, that he has built upon, abide, he shall receive wages. If any man's work burn, he shall endure loss, but he shall be saved himself: nevertheless yet as it were by the fire.</p>
<p>So it will be my loves that I will reward you fully for your service to me and the things that are burned away as chaff by my fires of judgment you will suffer loss and for those things that withstand my fires of judgment, even the works that I have given you to accomplish, great reward will be yours. For it is written: Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither has entered into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for them that love him. And so is the nature of your inheritance and reward, that not one man on earth understands fully the magnificence and glory of the inheritance of the eternal sons of God who are born again after the spirit of Christ, whereby you are born again sons of God for all eternity.</p>
<p>So understand my loves that the day of your full redemption is closer than you imagine, and it is speeding towards you right this very second and that day is soon to be fulfilled, sooner than you expect. Understand that there is no more time remaining to warn, no more time remaining to plead, no more time remaining to reason with secret Babylon because her judgment is final and cannot be altered. No, her times of repentance were wasted, and she ignored fully the voices of my prophets and apostles saying in her heart as she scoffed at my words “I sit as a queen and am no widow, tomorrow will be as today and today is the same as yesterday.”</p>
<p>Yet in one hour will her calamity fall fully on her, and never again will she rise. But in place of a once great nation that respected the ways of Yahweh and where people followed Jesus the Nazarene and were not ashamed to love their neighbors will a wasteland remain where Secret Babylon will be laid waste in one hour because strong is the Lord God which judges her. And as that calamity approaches ever closer my loves, so too does your full redemption, salvation, reward, and eternal joy, so fret not at the approaching judgment of sinners that is not for you if you come fully out of your sins.</p>
<p>And so that twinkling of an eye approaches where in a split second you will find yourselves standing in the throne room of Yahweh himself where your thrones are adorned and where you are seated as eternal kings and priests by the inheritance of your eternal Lord, whereby you shall rule the nations with a rod of iron for so is given to me, and so will I give to those who overcome. Who are my overcomers? Even those who came fully out of sin by full repentance and repudiation of their sins. And it is I Christ Jesus who has overcome the wiles of the devil fully and for all eternity, leaving him a desolate and fully defeated enemy of which the eternal flames of punishment are stoked and ready to receive, for so is their inheritance and so are they worthy.</p>
<p>Therefore, I have paved a mighty way for all who come to me fully to overcome fully the wiles of the devil in like manner as I did. So come to me fully that I may lead you on that straight and narrow path to your full salvation. Hear my voice those of you who have slipped and fallen in the way for a just man falls seven times, and rises again, so rise up Oh' men of God and come to me fully that I may reconnect you to your reward by cleansing you in my atoning blood that you may stand fully clothed in my righteousness. Understand that my overcomers will inherit all things and no good thing will be withheld from them. And so my overcomers, will forever shine, even as the brightness of the firmament: and you who have turned many to righteousness, will shine as the stars, for ever and ever. So now knowing this my children that now is time to leave the cares of this world and rest in me and stay pure as a virgin in my atoning blood.</p>
<p>Therefore, my loves stand fast in the face of approaching calamity, because you do see that terrible day approaching, and I am he who has opened the eyes of the humble in heart that you may see the truth of your world and not succumb to strong delusion that is not for you. Understand that I, Yeshua HaMashiach am the one who causes the blind to see, therefore, come to me that I may anoint your eyes with eye salve and that you may see in part this wicked world as it truly is in which you live. So fear not the judgment of sinners for that judgment is not for you my loves, no judgment is not for the redeemed because you have been saved from the wrath of the Lamb and from the wrath of God, wherefore stand fast and secure in your salvation my loves because the day is at hand and is speeding towards you ever closer by the second.</p>
<p>Yes that moment in time of your full redemption has come upon you my loves and that everlasting moment of time is nearly here and is coming upon you nearer and nearer by the second. I have confirmed in your spirits, I have shown signs above and signs in the earth, I have caused wonders in the heavens and even unleashed disasters in judgment on sinners and to wake those who slumber that they may understand that now is the time for full redemption of the children of the Almighty God, even my bride and my body.</p>
<div class="quotedlink bs-header"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro21">21</span><a href="/prophecy/o-israel-i-am-calling-you">O' Israel, I AM Calling You!</a><span>November 3, 2024</span></div>
<b>From YHVH, The Great Eternal God:</b>
<p>Hear the Words of Yahweh, The Great I AM and consider my question. Why do rats run from a collapsing house, my children? An obvious answer is for their own survival, except the rats who are running from Secret Babylon do so to hide their crimes, and so they can make spoil of her fully so they may have the short rule that I do give them. Since natural man loves darkness, I will now give him the darkness he so loves. Yet, I have recorded (and will yet record) every deed of every entity in my creation that has freedom to choose because to whom much is given is much required.</p>
<p>Yet Esau, who oppress my people, is deserting Mystery Babylon because they intend to cover their sins. A sin which rats deserting a collapsing house are not guilty. Therefore, they will attempt to bury their crimes and even their sinful shovels they used to cover their crimes and I will yet expose them, says The Lord of Hosts. For they have fully plundered Secret Babylon even as I have allowed to happen in my double portion of judgment on that great harlot!</p>
<p>And so they have gathered to themselves all of Secret Babylon's military might and they will continue to spoil until Secret Babylon is destroyed shortly in one hour and never again will she rise. Understand that no weapon that is formed or fashioned against you will prosper if you yet call on your true Messiah, even Yeshua HaMashiach!</p>
<div class="quotedlink bs-header"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro22">22</span><a href="/prophecy/when-they-shall-say-peace-and-safety">When They Shall Say Peace and Safety!</a><span>November 6, 2024</span></div>
<p>And so it is that nothing can alter the declarations of judgment given by Yahweh himself on Secret Babylon, even judgment that is given into my mighty hands to unleash when the faithful are gathered and the restrainer is removed, and it will suddenly occur just as promised! Even which judgments were announced in warning to the inhabitants of Secret Babylon, a warning they fully ignored as they faithlessly scoffed. Even my many, many warnings given in the mouths of my many prophets who have faithfully declared these Words of warning for many, many years now. Of which warnings I ceased and in their place declaration now stand, even declarations of Yahweh, and of Yeshua HaMashiach, even which declarations are impossible for any entity whatsoever to stop or alter. For what has been declared in the power and throne of Yahweh can no one change, for so are the ways of The Everlasting God of Righteousness, who works all things after the council of his own will.</p>
<p>Wherefore, I give you to understand that these two mangy shepherds who both are and are not and yet will FULLY be, have not yet fully risen, and they will fully rise from the ashes and ruins of the old order and their new order will rise fully! They have now selected for themselves their false Moshiach, even Barabbas, and he will build their temple, and the beast from the sea still puppeteers his senile old stooge and they will succeed, and they will bring Secret Babylon's full destruction, for by deception they do war and so is their nature.</p>
<p>And they are sent by the spider who has invaded the lands, and it is the spider who has chosen him to lead the lands when they are fully risen. Because it is the Synagogue of Satan that has made their choice and selected their new false Moshiach and Secret Babylon has once again given her consent to the dragon, and so they will fully be given into the hands of the dragon who empowers them to execute wrath and judgment that is even sent as a double portion from Yahweh himself, of which judgment lingers not and is imminent and so they have chosen to themselves their own destruction.</p>
<p>And so it is that Secret Babylon now declares her future to be free from Yahweh's judgment as they seek to escape as they scoff in their faithless ways. Because Secret Babylon is fully woven into the spider's web, and she cannot escape, and Secret Babylon is in chains awaiting her final judgment. And they will continue to spoil, rob, murder, plunder and take by force her prosperity and her posterity for so is given them to accomplish and a wasteland will remain where they will plunder the earth further for the resources they so lust.</p>
<p>And then sudden destruction will fall suddenly, and in one hour will she be destroyed. Again I say, that war will suddenly break free across the earth, and fire will fall, and many missiles will they send for her destruction. Her greatest city will burn and great waves of destruction will overtake her east and west coasts. The earth will violently shake, and she will be split up the middle and where a once prosperous heartland stood, waters will remain that will cleave her in two, and she will fully fall in her double portion of judgment. Even a judgment they chose for themselves when they ignored my voice I sent by way of my apostles and prophets and servants both great and small: truly she has ignored one and all to her own demise and never again will she rise. And so the earth is given into the hands of the dragon and he will give his infernal rule to his mangy shepherds who he has raised for his own purposes and they are corrupted forevermore.</p>
<p>Therefore, do not fall for their deception the beast from the earth brings because he does speak as a dragon. Do not follow those of Secret Babylon who are awaiting their judgment, for her judgment surely will come in one hour and suddenly she is not! Because those who could have followed Jesus the Nazarene as their Lord have now been wooed into the arms of a deceiver because they love to live their delusions, thinking that as it is today, it was yesterday, and surely this great king will make me great once again! But, you Secret Babylon, you will never be great again and your sins remain and you will not escape your judgment that is upon you. </p>
<p>So understand my loves that the hour has come for the dragon to fully rise and for war and judgment to fully come and that the beast from the sea and the beast from the earth may rise fully with their dragon. Had I not shortened the days no flesh would be left alive, and so their surprise attack will fully come on the world and they will utterly destroy Secret Babylon. So do not fall for their delusions and lies as they congratulate themselves and say openly in the face of Yahweh's judgments and the wrath of the Lamb “peace and safety” “peace and safety”! Because I am Yeshua HaMashiach who will fully remove peace and safety from the earth until the end of Daniel's seventieth week when I establish my Kingdom fully on the earth. Therefore, do not fall for their delusion.</p>
<div class="quotedlink bs-header"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro23">23</span><a href="/prophecy/a-lamb-with-two-horns">A Lamb With Two Horns</a><span>November 7, 2024</span></div>
<b>From YHVH: The Great I AM!</b>
<p>Behold! Great deception has come from Secret Babylon and has captivated the earth in its deadly embrace! Step right up to understand the great deception, oh you who dwell on the earth, and understand the times you live, because the great deception is here of which the earth is entertained because their world is a stage and their leaders are actors, even pretenders who pretend. And so I will now reveal the truth concerning their circus with which they use to enchant the masses.</p>
<p>So, this false Moshiach does travel and preach while speaking as a dragon and does pretend and say many great and blasphemous things even before he rises fully, and he will claim to rise. Understand my people that this false prophet who is also the beast from the earth who serves The Synagogue of Satan has now been selected as their lamb. And it will yet be that his head will appear as it were wounded to death, but his deadly wound was healed, and all the world will wonder and follow the beast. And so this deceiver will rise.</p>
<p>At his rising he will claim he has sacrificed himself like a lamb of God bringing peace to Israel as their dove which brings them an Olive leaf! And not only Israel, but the earth itself and will appear that he has now come back to bring peace, but the ways of peace he does not know and at the judgment of Secret Babylon all out war will ensue. Because a false spirit of comfort from the dragon has settled on the earth, and I have even sent strong delusion so that all those who have pleasure in unrighteousness will believe a lie that all might be damned who have pleasure in unrighteousness. For when they shall say peace and safety, then sudden destruction and they shall not escape.</p>
<p>And many in Secret Babylon, even those who believe his lies and follow his good words and fair speeches are captivated and ensnared by a false peace where they imagine that their delicious and sinful lives will continue where today is as yesterday and tomorrow will be the same as today and many will scream, howl, and lament that their hope is now taken from them, and they will fight their countrymen to the death and all the while their full surprise attack will be fully unleashed, even as my restrainer is lifted from the earth and Secret Babylon will fall to a double portion of judgment in one hour as many calamities fall.</p>
<p>And The Synagogue of Satan will have their war with which they have genocided the innocent in their deception to incite and those who worship their black cubes will exhaust themselves in slaughter, even a slaughter that is brought about purposefully by great deception and from the ashes they will rise. And the fallen ones will fully reveal themselves offering mankind seemingly benevolent help but their ways and technologies are intended to ensnare all they can in their inheritance in the flames of punishment, of which they will never escape and where they will receive many times over for EVERY single sin they have committed and justice will be done. But what fowler sets the snare in sight of the bird?</p>
<p>So I give you to understand, that Secret Babylon's judgment has been prepared and they stand at the ready. But first this false lamb with two horns will pretend to be virtuous when in fact he is a mangy shepherd, one of two horns to rule, even the little horn of Daniel. And he will appear that he has endeavored to save Secret Babylon by purging her corruption but in truth he is a great corrupter who ensnared many that he will now purge and blame for his corruption with which he extorted many into submission. And now all that does not suit their purposes, or who can testify first hand of their evil will be removed by the hands of this mangy shepherd and blamed for the sins they still partake and of which they lead others, and they will not escape.</p>
<p>And, also understand that many who are party to their crimes and who are tares like unto these mangy shepherds will move into their bunkers and hide themselves in the heart of the earth from the wrath to come and they will destroy all evidence of the lives they assumed in Secret Babylon in great deceit, and they will not escape the wrath to come! Yet, so it is that their sins will be exposed hypocritically by this false prophet and he will appear to be just and upright, even a man sent by God for the salvation of Israel and so the trap is ready to spring. And yet, every one of their deeds I have recorded in the books in the heavens, and I do personally remember every detail and I know all of their crimes and I will expose them and they will eternally pay forevermore for their vile sins.</p>
<p>Yet so will it be that when the restrainer is taken the evil that is latent within mankind due to the serpent's wiles will now go unrestrained and madness will overtake the earth as brother will kill brother and countrymen will fight their countrymen and extreme chaos and war will overtake the earth. And yet this event is the destruction and judgment of mystery Babylon, but the seals are set to be loosed, and the horseman will ride!</p>
<div class="quotedlink bs-header"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro24">24</span><a href="/prophecy/behold-the-lion-of-the-tribe-of-judah">Behold! The Lion of the Tribe of Judah!</a><span>November 17, 2024</span></div>
<p>I am he who will break the seals on my scroll of inheritance, even the very deed to the earth that I have purchased in my own atoning blood from the hand of Yahweh himself. And I do come to root out the squatters and all those the fallen ones have sent, and even the fallen ones themselves and their times are at an end. So understand what is to come, Israel, because they will establish their kingdom and they will appear victorious and many lying signs and wonders will they show so they may deceive all who have pleasure in unrighteousness. And they will think they have established the start of their golden age wherewith they lust to establish, because they are of their Father the devil, and the devil is that great dragon, therefore, the lusts of the dragon they will do.</p>
<p>Yet, they will have no golden age but only severe and harsh judgment, of which judgment will commence quickly as my faithful in Christ are gathered to me in the clouds as I make my appearing of which the earth will see. Yet, they will lie and tell the world that enemy aliens have stolen many away from the earth and they will return and the earth must be ready to fight these pretend invaders. Yet in truth they are preparing themselves to the battle of that great day, even the day of my second coming, even a day where the birds of the air will feast greatly on the flesh of their fallen kings of the earth and so will it be.</p>
<p>And as the judgments accumulate, as the seals are broken (the horsemen will ride) and the trumpets will sound and it will happen even as written of John the Revelator and also according to the Words of The Everlasting Gospel that has been revealed in its time that Israel may be readied against the day of their trouble and readied for the day of their salvation, which lingers not. And many will blaspheme the God of heaven for the judgments that are to come upon them and many will not repent, and most will take their beastly jab and mix themselves with technologies they do not understand, because their technologies are for the destruction of Adam so hide yourselves away O' Israel.</p>
<div class="quotedlink bs-header"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro25">25</span><a href="/prophecy/the-temple-of-esau">The Temple Of Esau</a><span>November 23, 2024</span></div>
<p>So understand the time has come, even as declared and announced where I will suddenly gather the faithful in Christ into the heavens whether they be living or dead; and as the faithful saints are suddenly taken sudden destruction will overtake Secret Babylon who sits on many waters, which are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues. And as the ashes of war smolder and the current arrangement of nations is decimated and realigned to suit their purposes, the fallen one's final beast system will rise in full.</p>
<p>Yet, the beast from the sea and the beast from the earth have played the role of virtuous shepherds who came to shepherd the lost sheep of Secret Babylon with many empty promises; even false promises that ultimately bring death and destruction. And they pretend to be enemies behind the facade of a senile old stooge behind whom they hide themselves and of which stooge is there to take the blame for their crimes; and they do control his every move and script his every word. Because this great deception is given in judgment on Secret Babylon; that strong delusion should overtake her fully because she has covered the earth in her lies having a golden cup in her hand, full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication. </p>
<p>And yet these two evil beasts have spoiled Secret Babylon, even before her destruction has come and have taken her military might and abundance for the dragon's purposes in their coming final beast system. Because the war that is to come will devour Secret Babylon, and truly she will be destroyed in one hour, for so has been declared of Yahweh, even the Great I AM. Yet, this is by design and is also set in Yahweh's plan of redemption (that his enemies should obey his voice) and so the great Harlot's judgment is declared, and written, and so shall it be done forevermore, and never will she rise again. Even so, they will split the earth and great shaking will occur, and they have engineered her destruction that they may gather the resources of which they lust that are buried in the earth. Even the resources with which they need to power and expand the fallen one's technologies; even wherewith the world is currently mesmerized and enchanted in its strong delusion, kept enthralled to their frequencies and manipulations wherewith they are stimulated and controlled.</p>
<p>And of the people that will remain after the coming destruction of Secret Babylon; the beast from the earth and the beast from the sea have imported an army of invaders and executioners into her borders whose numbers are as a mighty plague of locusts, and they will be unleashed at their signal! Because these are the armies of the beast who have been gathered for Secret Babylon's destruction. Many of these are from the lands of the dragon and the lands of the bear, and they will do as Secret Babylon secretly did to them in jubilees past: They will kill every man, woman and child with no remorse who does not suit their purposes and many who are allowed to remain alive will be forced into their slave camps to work in their mines to their deaths. And they will toil and labor till their last breath; because all that Secret Babylon has secretly done to others will now be done openly to her in her judgment and punishment. Because Secret Babylon is drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus that she has martyred in great abundance in foreign lands; all the while claiming that she herself serves Jesus the Nazarene.</p>
<p>But in truth she serves the fallen ones and her purposes are now over, and they do lust for her destruction so they can cover their crimes and so that their mangy shepherds may appear virtuous when they rise in order to hide their trap. Yet, they can never hide themselves from Yahweh, nor Yeshua HaMashiach and their crimes are recorded perfectly in the heavens and every sin is recorded in perfect detail along with the thoughts and intents of their polluted hearts. And the beast from the sea and the beast from the earth are evil abominations created for the destruction of mankind. These evil beasts are child molesters, and they collect and use the bodies of the little ones that they have killed to make their abominations and so all they destroy are given in sacrifice to their god. Because they took up the Tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of their god Remphan, figures which they made, to worship them, and much much more have they done that will be revealed fully at the proper times of revealing because every secret will come to light.</p>
<p>So will it be that the beast from the earth will seem to rise as it were from the grave; even claiming that he is risen from the dead, even the very heart of the earth because death could not hold him! And he will have his false resurrection and bring a false peace on the earth to end their war, and he will appear that he has come to save mankind. And the fallen ones will reveal themselves to mankind as benevolent helpers who are far superior in wisdom and advanced in the ways of technology, medicine, and peace.</p>
<p>They will produce many lying signs and wonders, and they will say that those who have been gathered in Christ at the great gathering and taken into the safety of the heavens before great calamity fell; that even these were taken by force by a pretend extraterrestrial enemy. Even a hostile alien force that will come again to destroy humanity, and they will rally natural man to unite with them in order to save himself from this evil they imagine in their pretend universe of ever falsely spinning pretend worlds in an ever expanding void of nothingness.</p>
<p>Even a lying cosmology that the fallen ones imagined and used before in their golden age of old, of which golden age met its end at the hands of Yahweh in the great flood in the times of Noah, of which records are engraven in the holy writings of old. And of which lies will be hurled to the ground because their great deception will be fully laid bare that all may see these pretenders who pretend for who they truly are because they are fallen beings from the heavenly realm who have long since corrupted themselves in pointless rebellion from Yahweh's righteousness even so that they may inherit their own destruction that they have made for themselves in their inheritance of burning brimstone of which they will never escape.</p>
<p>And so the beast from the earth will rise seemingly from the dead and with many lying signs and wonders will he appear, even with his olive branch in hand. Because the mystery of iniquity has been at work through the ages; where the great whore who sits on seven mountains, even that great scarlet whore of blasphemy who worships the queen of heaven and who teaches another Jesus as part of their pagan trinity. Even whose roots are in ancient Babylon where Nimrod began his fables with the queen of heaven. Of whose legacy and priests and bloodlines trace their lineage to the fallen ones who ruled ancient Babylon with their unholy three with which they use to mock the true godhead, and the promised seed of the woman. These pagan practices and rites have dominated the earth in great secrecy where the initiated priests of the fallen ones secretly worship the sun but claim they are The Society of Jesus; and so has their false and blasphemous pretend church exerted oppression and persecution over the earth during the days the mystery of iniquity spread in secret. Therefore, their destruction lingers not and their times have come!</p>
<p>Yet these two evil beasts, even who currently work hand in hand for the full destruction of secret Babylon, even the beast from the sea and the beast from the earth; even these two who have both been ruling heads of Secret Babylon and who have ruled with many great and empty promises wherewith these two mangy shepherds have shepherded the lost sheep of Secret Babylon promising false material prosperity and abundance to those they shepherd. And in their hands and by their schemes they have surely arranged and will execute what has been given into the hands of the dragon to accomplish.</p>
<p>Because Secret Babylon, even that great whore who sits on many waters is a nation that was made, so these two evil beasts could rise from her ashes in their times of revealing. Even an adulterous nation, even a nation of fornication, a nation that is indeed a great harlot claiming herself a righteous follower of Jesus the Nazarene. But in truth is a nation whose builders are free from the true Rock of Foundation, even that great cornerstone of which the faithless stumble, even Jesus the Nazarene who is also Yeshua HaMashiach.</p>
<p>And so these evil builders have made themselves free from salvation and committed themselves to that lake of fire where their worm dies not by rejecting the chief cornerstone and rock of offense and they will not escape!</p>
<div class="quotedlink bs-header"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro26">26</span><a href="/prophecy/the-mirror-lies">The Mirror Lies</a><span>December 5, 2024</span></div>
<p>Understand that the beast from the sea has distanced himself from Secret Babylon that he may distance himself from his crimes which are many, and they will smear his name and seem to make accusations against him. But understand that the beast from the sea and the beast from the earth are from the same abominable bloodlines and work hand in hand, even a beastly duo, to serve and satisfy the dragon's lustful purposes. The beast from the sea will rise in his time and he will rise to become their promised warrior, even their Mahdi for whom they currently wait. And he will conceal his true nature and his past and his crimes, though such efforts are futile because every sin he has ever committed is perfectly recorded in the heavens. Although, he will fool those who follow him by his empty promises.</p>
<p>And as they rise from the ashes of war, they will openly align themselves with the dragon and the fallen ones of whose they already are, and they will quickly move to establish themselves in their final empire, of which they have already set the framework in place, even before Secret Babylon is destroyed by way of the mystery of iniquity. Yet, they will seek to build that which has already been as the fallen ones seek to establish their new golden age, even a golden age they will never have but harsh judgment instead.</p>
<p>Understand what they will do, O' Israel, because they will make war with the saints and they will overcome them, and all who call on the name of Jesus the Nazarene who is also Yeshua HaMashiach to the end shall be saved, for so it is promised and written. They will blame those who call on the name of Jesus for their crimes and Barabbas will betray the saints of Secret Babylon because many of them have unknowingly dedicated their Churches to the beast from the earth, who is yet to come at the time of this writing. And he has made himself their Lord and peddled Bibles in his own name, yet a Christian he readily admits he is not, although, many foolishly believe that he is.</p>
<div class="quotedlink bs-header"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro27">27</span><a href="/prophecy/two-horns-of-a-lamb">Two Horns Of A Lamb</a><span>January 9, 2025</span></div>
<p>Judgment falls! Judgment falls! Judgment falls! Behold! Judgment falls on Secret Babylon, even as promised, even because my many warnings were ignored, even because my Words sent by my messengers and prophets for the salvation of those who have now chosen judgment and their own destruction in disobedient rebellion were tossed aside like worthless refuse. Thus was it written, and so it is coming to pass: And the ten horns which you saw upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate, and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. For God hath put in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.</p>
<p>And so it is coming to pass that judgment falls on Secret Babylon, and her pleasures are taken from her in judgment. And shortly now it will fully come to pass as it has been written by John the Revelator who faithfully recorded the Words given by my hand: For in one hour so great riches are come to desolation. Therefore, riches and pleasures are being taken from the earth and will not return until my millennial kingdom has come and this is done in judgment and punishment on those who lusted after these delicacies with the intent that they may come to repentance should they turn with full faith in their hearts to Jesus the Nazarene by calling on my name at the expense of their own lives to obtain salvation from a judged and dying world that truly, truly will come to utter destruction and judgment and none shall escape except through the grace and mercy of Yahweh given in the face of Christ Jesus the resurrected and ascended King of Righteousness!</p>
<p>Even though, at the time of this writing the great gathering of the faithful in Christ has not occurred and many of my faithful struggle to not lose hope in their Lord's imminent appearing by impatience and many temptations. Therefore, I, Christ Jesus, do give you to understand that the gathering of the faithful in Christ is already in motion and cannot be stopped nor delayed, and so understand that what has been declared and set in motion in the throne and power of Yahweh cannot be changed, nor altered in the least and will come to pass exactly as foretold and at the exact perfect time chosen by Yahweh himself, because whatever it is that Yahweh sets to purpose will come to pass in complete perfection for so is the glory of Yahweh, The Great I AM!</p>
<p>Come out from among them and be separate, and so I warn you again because it is time to depart from the cares of this evil world because your departure is at hand. I counsel you to live your remaining, fleeting time in righteousness so that you may be at the ready for your Lord's voice so that I may command you in service to your neighbor that you are to love, even in the same manner that you love yourselves that you may sow seeds of righteousness in their hearts and bring the stragglers to the Ark before that great open door in the heavens slams shut in judgment. I counsel you to live the time remaining in righteousness so that you may be ready for the voice of your Lord and so that you might hear that mighty shout when the final trumpet blows to gather the faithful in Christ. And my appearing will be seen and known worldwide because as the lightning comes out of the east, and is seen into the west, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. Yet so will it be when I revealed myself to Paul on the road to Damascus that those who are accepted into the heavens will hear the trumpet and understand its sound and many will see my glory break across the skies. Yet, most will not be able to distinguish that mighty shout and not understand the utterance given thereby, and so they will remain.</p>
<p>So I give you to understand that at the time of my appearing the brightness of my glory will fill the heavens and my glory will be seen and the world will know and understand for a moment that Christ Jesus has made his appearing because the faithful in Christ will be suddenly taken into the safety of the heavens where they will stand before their Lord, even recreated in eternal righteousness forevermore! And those left behind who were so sure they would be accepted at my appearing will weep, howl, and fall into great and bitter distress. Even so, as the gravity of their situation and future settles on them. Then many of them will fully commit themselves to call on my name no matter what and to call on my name to the end, and they will be resurrected into indescribable glory because the weight of their eternal reward is not worthy to compare to the sufferings experienced in this evil world, so says your eternal Lord who willingly hung on a stake for your salvation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, so will it be that the beast from the sea, the beast from the earth who is also the false prophet will all rise in their time, even when they are released by the restrainer to do what is given for them to accomplish in the short time that they will be, and never will they rise again in such fashion. And in great deception will he literally claim to rise from the dead, because the beast from the earth will surely fake his own head-wound and great calamity will ensue as a result, even as foretold previously by Yahweh in A Lamb With Two Horns.</p>
<p>Understand that they will hide themselves away during their calamitous war that they are waging currently that will be fully loosed when the restrainer is removed and their war will be fulfilled with all the destruction that their war will bring. Because out of utter chaos will their new order rise and the beast from the earth will lie and claim that he is risen from the dead for the salvation of Israel and to cleanse the world of evil, even an evil that they themselves will fully bring. Therefore, understand that the fallen ones are those who seek to mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another, just as iron and clay is not mixed with clay. Understand that the fallen ones have developed many lying technologies and tricks to control and deceive those who dwell on the earth, and even all who have pleasure in unrighteousness. Understand that they have developed many abominations made for the destruction of natural man from the face of the earth. Understand that the watchers have once again made their abominations, and understand that the fallen ones have learned to copy and clone life that has been breathed into the nostrils of mankind because mankind was created in the image of Yahweh.</p>
<p>Therefore, understand that any abomination made by the fallen ones is not made in the image of Yahweh but is an imitation of life, and is not made fully from the kind of Adam and therefore, cannot be redeemed neither achieve salvation and is intended for the complete and total destruction of Adam and all abominations that are made in like manner are bound to fulfill the lusts of their Fathers that they will surely do. That which is crooked cannot be made straight and they will have neither root nor branch and they will all go to eternal judgment for the evils they have committed.</p>
<p>Understand further that the beast from the earth does come to rule with his venom in hand, even that eternal snakebite that is also the mark of the beast. Understand that anyone from Adam, male or female, who willingly takes the mark of the beast will be forevermore altered from the image of Yahweh forevermore, and will be slaves bound to the will of the hive mind because their minds will be linked to the internet of things to be, even an internet made for demons and fallen angels to possess and control. What? You thought their technologies were for the benefit of man and that mankind developed these technologies by tinkering around in a garage? Repudiate their lies my loves and do not fall victim to their senseless fables.</p>
<p>So it will be that all who take their mark will be meshed with their technologies and will become nodes in their network and will be controlled by their technologies and frequencies and they will be the walking damned who can never attain salvation in their altered state and all who join themselves to their technologies and alterations are forever bound to their judgments, never to depart, and they will have their portion in the fallen ones inheritance of burning brimstone for all eternity.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the fallen ones continue in their insanity and madness as they seek to escape the firmament under which they are bound for judgment. They continue to make their abominations and they have many technologies of which natural man is not yet aware. And as in the days of old natural man will continue to worship the fallen ones on account of their so called technologies and manipulations. Many of their abominations are made even as in the days of Noah by fornication between the fallen angels and women taken from the children of men. Many of the fallen ones already walk openly among the children of men in disguise of their true selves, and many more appear fully human but are hybrids between angels and men, just as it was in the days of Noah. Behold! I bring giants to fulfill my wrath!</p>
<p>So I give you to understand their many of their deceptions will cause fire to fall from the sky in the sight of men, even where they already cause much destruction and they will continue to develop and reveal their technologies even so that the beast from the earth who is also their false Moshiach will cause fire to fall from the heavens in the sight of men, even a cheap counterfeit devised to appear powerful against my two witnesses who will shortly rise in their times of prophecy and power. Because my two witnesses who are my two candlesticks, who are my two olive trees will cause fire to fall from heaven at their command, and just as Jannes and Jambres stood against Moses and Aaron, so to will the beast and false prophet withstand my two Olive trees seeking to counterfeit the true power of Yahweh, The Great I AM!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the beast from the earth is an alternating copy of himself, except in his deception he appears that he is one, but in reality he is two of which you will not see both at the same time. Because a twin it is not but an abominable copy of himself. Therefore, understand the duality of their occultic beliefs to understand their methods and insane ways of which they seek to overcome you my loves, and remain firm and fixed with your eyes on Jesus the Nazarene, who is also Yeshua HaMashiach because I have overcome them already. Therefore, stand fast and you will fully overcome their evil schemes that come to nothing. So understand the dual nature of the lamb with two horns who speaks like the dragon because he brings a two state solution to rule the earth with the beast from the sea, and he will make an image of himself in similar fashion as Nebuchadnezzar, and of himself there is not one but two that the dragon will use to deceive the world with his lying signs and wonders. Except, a golden image he will not make but an image used for lying signs and wonders made of their worthless technologies that are so soon to be made an eternal end.</p>
<p>Yet so are the nature of their deceptions because they have no heavenly power any longer because in their defilement they have been stripped of all honor and all authority and no longer are they endowed with the power of Yahweh, but go about in their own strength and hatefully manipulate the creation in their worthless mysteries to seem as gods to natural man who runs after them in his lusts for their technologies and seemingly powerful ways and false occultic systems of death that will lead all who partake to those hottest flames of blue in that great lake of fire where the flames of punishment ever burn the hottest purity.</p>
<p>And so is the nature of their deception that they should set themselves as if they are gods, when in reality they are pretenders who pretend. And in their lying signs and wonders what will cause the world to wonder after them, saying who is like the beast? Except in reality they will be fully deceived and captured by the dragon's worthless lying signs and wonders and through many deceptions will they deceive the unrighteous who will follow them eternally, bound to them forevermore. Because the skies under the firmament are now filled with the fallen ones themselves, and their technologies, and even with holographic images they will display to cover my appearing that will happen so unexpectedly now.</p>
<p>They will use their technologies to keep natural man chained to his coming judgment and destruction and the majority of those who dwell on the earth in unrighteousness will follow their ways, never to return and persecute my beloved doves again, because they will be forevermore cast to the flames. Therefore, I give you to understand the fullness of their deception that they will cause lying signs and wonders by their hidden technologies that are mere manipulations of the glory of Yahweh's creation that is reserved for the inheritance of the meek. They will use their CGI technologies to make their images so lifelike that those who are bound to stare at their mirrors by way of the mark of the beast will utterly live a false reality, very similar to the false reality brought about by the mystery of iniquity currently where people go from screen to screen, even holding the digital chains of their bondage happily in hand as they are inundated with useless knowledge that utterly results in arrogant delusion, even separated from reality for all eternity should the not repent!</p>
<p>Their AI will rise fully, and is nothing more than demons working through their technologies, even built by the hands of the children of men. Yet, artificial intelligence it is not, but a vehicle for disembodied spirits to thrive, and a means of control and deception wherewith to make it appear that their lying signs and wonders are divine power given to support their lies.</p>

<b>From YHVH: The Great I AM!</b>
<p>Nevertheless, I have allowed time and provision for those the faithful in Christ do intercede so that they may escape sudden destruction that will fall any minute now, even so that they may be saved alive and that they may come to salvation by the refiners fire should they so choose their own salvation. Therefore, come fully out from amongst them and be fully separate from them so that you do not share in their judgments.</p>
<p>Also, understand that the enemies of Secret Babylon have been given her resources and wealth fully, and Secret Babylon is now a looted shell of its former self that has no chance for survival, and never again will this sinful and abominable nation rise, even a nation that was made secretly by the fallen ones that served the unintended purpose of providing a refuge for the persecuted who served Christ Jesus (because even my enemies obey my voice) and for the intended purpose that the beast from the sea and the beast from the earth could rise and be selected for their purposes by the fallen ones in their times.</p>
<p>Truly, many abominations have been created in her lands and many cities, tunnels, and bases are under the earth where they will seek to hide themselves. Nevertheless, there is nowhere they can go to escape the wrath of the Lamb and the wrath of Yahweh that will be unleashed according to the Words given to John the Revelator and many of them will be buried in their caves in judgment and will not escape the flames of punishment for their crimes. Yet, they do burn Secret Babylon as they seek to cover their crimes, but their efforts are futile and I, Yahweh, The Great I AM have recorded and do remember every detestable act, no matter how seemingly small.</p>
<div class="quotedlink bs-header"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro29">29</span><a href="/prophecy/behold-momentary-closure-of-testimony">Behold! Momentary Closure of Testimony, Convergence, and Separation</a><span>January 22, 2025</span></div>
<p>Thus, will the earth be given into the hands of the dragon for a short season, even a season of harsh judgment where the dwellers on the earth will fully have the evil and darkness they so lust and desire, except no golden age will they have but harsh and everlasting judgment instead. And the fallen ones will have their war with which they will fully subjugate the earth in full, unrestrained evil, and full unrestrained unrighteousness, and that great scarlet whore will fall to the flames of judgment as Secret Babylon is fully judged and destroyed at the departure of the faithful in Christ, never to rise again! Understand that they will hide themselves away in their underground cities and bunkers, and bases, and shelters, but many of them will not escape but will be buried in the earth in full judgment, even preserved in torment in death until that great white throne judgment and they shall not escape.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the same way that this transfer of ruler-ship will occur in great destruction and war as the fallen ones do what is given into their hands to accomplish at the full judgment of Secret Babylon that sits on many waters that are people, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues; even as they conquer the nations for their unholy rule of which I will make an eternal end at the end of Jacobs trouble. That in similar fashion, at my second coming, when I return to earth with the heavenly host and the faithful in Christ and even my Bride, that in righteousness I will judge and make war and put down eternally and forevermore with great violence and force all ruler-ship and authority and dominion of the dragon! Because he is no king, and he has no kingdom and his inheritance is in those everlasting flames of punishment where their worm dies not, where he is bound in judgment to go evermore.</p>
<div class="quotedlink bs-header"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro30">30</span><a href="/prophecy/a-segue-for-the-faithful-in-christ">A Segue for The Faithful in Christ, Then Sudden Destruction on Earth</a><span>February 24, 2025</span></div>
<p>Then shall it happen, even as foretold, that sudden destruction will fall on Secret Babylon and her coasts will be covered, she shall be split along the middle from the gulf to the lakes, great fire will fall and their missiles will be launched, even my mighty Angel will cast a great stone into the sea and Secret Babylons greatest city shall not escape, nor the city of Angels because truly, truly, her sinful cities will burn and be overthrown. The armies of the beast will be released and they shall hunt every person and will cull multitudes, and they have orders to eliminate all who do not suit their purposes, or who could rise to fight them another day. Thus, so shall their third world war occur.</p>
<p>Great shaking and total war will destroy many nations and cities and towns and the earth will be divided in many places, and the restrainer shall be suddenly removed, and the ice shall fall, and their abominations will be unleashed and the abyss will be opened and Satans full kingdom will be unleashed and united in evil in their war against the saints wherewith they shall overcome them even as written. And great judgment shall suddenly fall, even as warned, and declared and so shall it be that great judgment will fall across the entire earth when the transfer is completed. And this because natural man desires the fallen ones and desires their evil and darkness, therefore, evil and darkness will natural man now have and his only escape is to call on the name of Jesus until his end, because the rebellious of Adam will now be given fully to the Satans who will destroy. Yet, I will come to save a mighty remnant from Jacob at the hands of my mighty 144,000! Selah!</p>
<p>I am, Christ Jesus, and I have previously declared the gathering of the faithful in Christ to their Everlasting and Eternal Lord, even in the Gospel of Salvation and The Mystery of God and The Everlasting Gospel and I do come to establish the surety of my declarations and also the declarations of Yahweh, for whatever declarations are made in the throne and power of Yahweh will come to pass exactly as declared and there will be no more delay.</p>
