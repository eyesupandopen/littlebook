<h1 id="ph">For God is Not the Author of Confusion!</h1>
<div id="prophecy">
<p>For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints! Read these words and hearken to my voice. Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine heart unto my knowledge. Perhaps you should follow my example from the garden as I prayed in agony when I fell on the ground before my Father in prayer and humility, and he strengthened me to accept the cup of wrath of your very own sins that I took on myself for you, for I am able to bear them. I speak to the haughty ones in my Church, and I speak to the many divisions amongst you. But why dost thou judge thy brother? Or why dost thou set at naught thy brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. Is it not written to the letter I sent to followers of the Way at Rome? But what saith Zechariah on the matter: But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear. Have you not read Isaiah, my little ones? For what saith the prophets of old? For Isaiah says again, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand: and seeing you shall see, and shall not perceive.</p>
<p>My children, I have shown you a more excellent way, but many of you are fallen from grace and your arrogant pride has caused you to elevate yourselves above measure. Yet, my words I gave to the Apostle Paul for Galatia plainly state: For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself. My little children, I know you are eager in heart to serve me, and I know you love me, just at times not according to knowledge. Do you not understand that God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble? Therefore, humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time. Likewise, you younger people, submit yourselves to your elders. Yes, all of you be submissive to one another, and be clothed with humility. God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble. Don't consider my words repetitive, for in the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established. Understand, my children, you cannot serve me with your flesh: For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. My Church, submit yourselves one to another in a mind clothed in humility, for I might be the one giving the words to say and the inspiration to teach you, though many of you will set the voice of the humble aside in favor of someone's reputation and person. Be followers of God, my children, for of a truth God is no respecter of persons.</p>
<p>Behold! It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honor of Kings is to search out a matter. Understand that I will make you kings and priests before our God and our Father, so understand the sayings of the wise among you: has not God given you two ears and one mouth? Have you not read? Every one of you has a Psalm, has a doctrine, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation: Let all things be done unto edifying! But no, you bite and devour one another in your arrogance; in your pride you attack those who try to teach you, and you have become unteachable. You argue, bicker, debate, and fight one another instead of humble consideration of what the other says. On the other side, are you so prideful to think that because the words come out of your lips that they are true because YOU said them? Submit yourselves one to another. Hold your tongue and take the words of your brethren to scripture to prove all things and hold fast to the good. Unstop your ears and listen fully and consider, for in so doing I will make you wise in your humility, so be not wise in your own conceits. I counsel everyone among you, hear my words. And what do those words say? For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.</p>
<p>No, stop, consider the words I just gave you, open your Bibles and read these words again. Hear them and believe them, for you owe it to yourself to think highly of yourselves, for I have raised you up together and made you sit together in heavenly places in me, Christ Jesus. But at the same time you should think soberly, for God has given to every man among you the same measure of faith, so the spirit given is not greater or less in your brethren, but to every one of you is given grace, according to the measure of the gift of Christ. Wherefore he saith: When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men. I have given some apostles: and some prophets: and some evangelists: and some pastors, and teachers: For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ. Submit to one another and drop your worthless pride as it causes factions among you. Why do you not understand that there should be no divisions among you, my children. Is the body of Christ divided? What have I said to the Corinthians?</p>
<p>Now I beseech you brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you: but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the same judgment. Are you not all one in me, the Lord Jesus Christ? Yet you have so many factions among you, and you bite and devour each other for the tiniest disagreements. Know that in your factions and backbiting you amuse Satan, and he brags on your utter futility of effort spent fighting among yourselves because many of you lack humility. And your ears are stopped up so you cannot hear each other's voices, and you have closed your eyes, and they are glued shut in pride and unbelief, for so many of you think you have the all truth. And you discount the words of your brethren, and you discount the very words that I have given them for you, and in your arrogant pride you lack the basic humility to hear and consider. For if a man heareth not a thing, it is folly and shame to him. And again, why do you set at naught your brethren, for we must all stand before the judgment seat of Christ? I counsel you, my Church, to repudiate your pride and haughty ways and come to me as a student of the Word of life, for I am the Word of God made flesh.</p>
<p>So listen with your full soul and give heed to the sounds of your ears and perceive my words. So understand the order of events given in my Word, for many of you are deceived by ravenous wolves that you ignorantly follow, for you have listened to the wayward shepherds. Who are you to preach that there is no gathering together of my Church to me, that I will not meet my Church in the air when I come with a mighty shout and the voice of the archangel and with the trump of God? For the trumpet shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise first and you which are alive and remain will not precede them, and you will all be caught up in the clouds to meet me and forevermore will you be with me. Are these words too good for you to believe? Or will you believe the words of the Judaizing wayward shepherds over the voice of your Lord and savior, Christ Jesus? Why do you not have faith in my Word nor in the very words that comprise my Word? Do you not understand what a biblical mystery is or its purpose?</p>
<p>I will tell you: A mystery is a thing kept secret but prophesied of that is revealed at the proper time. And why would the Father do such a thing, you ask? Have you not read my report? But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world, unto our glory. Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. Who are you to discount my Father's plans and ways? For he needs no counselor, though ten thousand times ten thousand surround his throne.</p>
<p>So comfort yourselves together with my words, for you are saved from wrath in me. Then, in your faithless ways, you argue over the timing of this event. Even though some of you erroneously say there is no gathering, many of you debate the timing of its occurrence in relation to Jacob's trouble. I will make it plain for you if you will listen, though many of you will stubbornly deny this event, even denying me and absolutely sealing your destiny to take your place amongst the unwise virgins. For what says my Word?</p>
<p>Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our assembling unto him, That ye be not suddenly moved from your mind, nor troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter, as it were from us, as though the day of Christ were at hand. Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a departing first, and that that man of sin be disclosed, even the son of perdition. (Look to the Byzantine, my children, for many corrupt Bibles have come from gnostic texts, fake texts given by sinful men. Do you not understand the difference between a biblical text and a Bible version?) There will be a falling away from the faith in apostasy, and those who refuse to depart from the faith will depart from the earth to meet me in the air.</p>
<p>For herein is the parable of the ten virgins. Five wise virgins purchased oil and trimmed their wicks and were ready when the bridegroom arrived, and five were not ready and neglected to buy oil, trying instead to take from the needs of others. The five prepared virgins continued with the bridegroom, and the five unwise asked to be let in afterwards and were told, depart from me, I never knew you. Quench not my spirit in you that would verify these words. Understand the son of perdition cannot come into power and Satan's full kingdom cannot rise from the abyss until the restrainer is removed, and since you are saved from wrath, the restrainer will be removed when I gather my Bride to myself in the clouds when she meets me in the air.</p>
<p>Then at the end of the seven years of Jacob's trouble comes the resurrection of the just. Behold! And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshiped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be Priests of God, and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.</p>
<p>Do you still not believe my words? Verily, many of you will stubbornly cling to your error and the words of the wayward shepherds, and many of you who could have escaped the wrath of God that comes to try the earth during Jacob's trouble, choosing instead to endure great wrath when I have already proven you and tried you, except you will stubbornly refuse my appearing, and you will cling to wrath that is not intended for you. Did I not tell you to come out of her lest you share in her plagues?</p>
<p>Yet, there will be one more resurrection. And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away, and there was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God: and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the Book of Life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it: and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works, for this is the resurrection of the unjust my people.</p>
<p>Why do you not understand that the gathering together of my Church to meet me in the clouds at my appearing is different from my return with my Bride and the armies in heaven? Why do you not understand that the gathering of my Church is a mystery revealed by the Apostle Paul in the context of the Great Mystery of God. So it is a mystery within a mystery, and it was not fully unveiled to the sons of men until it was revealed to Paul who wrote it down, and I have preserved it for you.</p>
<p>Yet, there are several examples of God taking people into the heavens for specific purposes. Enoch departed. Elijah departed. I departed into the heavens while my apostles watched in awe. Philip was departed from one place to another as the Father took him for my purposes. And so shall my bride be gathered to me in the clouds to be taken into the heavens to be married to me and to serve my redeeming purposes.</p>
<p>Do you not understand that my Bride will be kings and priests before my God and Father and will rule with me in my coming kingdom and will forever be with me? Why are you so slow to believe my words? Have you been enchanted and led astray by the wayward shepherds? Still, many of you will become a self-fulfilling prophecy and will seal yourselves to the falling away by apostatizing from my precepts, particularly the doctrine of my Church being gathered to me. Shame on you who group this doctrine to false prophets in recent history, declaring a false, secret rapture that is tied to other false doctrines of dispensations.</p>
<p>Understand that there are ages in God's timeline and not dispensations, and they are not the same concept. Study to show yourselves approved, and quit being so intellectually lazy. Quit relying on and reading everyone else's interpretation of what is written, and live by it is written: For you need not that any man should teach you. Yet, many of you will scoff and refuse my counsel. Except this thing will not be done in secret and Satan will launch a great deception to cover this event because it will be known worldwide. Great shaking will occur, and the entire world will change from the world you have known, and that man of sin will be revealed and rise from the ashes left behind by the four horseman. It is time to ready yourselves, my Bride, and do so quickly, for behold my appearing is at hand!</p>
<div class="indent">
<p>I am the son of Man prophesied of by Enoch, whom God took into the heavens.</p>
<p>I am he who was transfigured and spoke with Moses and Elijah about my departing, and God took Elijah into the heavens in his time.</p>
<p>I am he who was taken into a cloud as I was received into the heavens until the times of restitution.</p>
<p>I am he who sent Philip to the Ethiopian eunuch before God took him to another place on earth.</p>
<p>I am he who caught Paul away to the third heaven and showed him unspeakable things that he was not free to share.</p>
<p>I am he who will descend from the heavens with a great shout to gather my Bride to meet me in the air.</p>
<p>I am he who will raise my two witnesses to life after they are dead for three and a half days, and I till take them into the heavens.</p>
<p>I am he that is the Alpha and Omega, for I am the beginning and the end, and behold! I come sooner than you think, so be ready to meet me or fall away.</p>
</div>
<p>Whosever calls on the name of the Lord to the end will be saved.</p>
