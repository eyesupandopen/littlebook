<h1 id="ph">Take Up A Lamentation</h1>
<div id="prophecy">
<p>The words the Lord has given me, I openly declare: Hear the Word of the Lord!</p>
<p>Take up a lamentation; truly, take up a lamentation for those who yet hold to this fallen world. For they have said in their hearts, "What can come upon me? As it has been of old, it shall continue yet indefinitely; and I and mine will continue to live deliciously, and we shall heap to ourselves this world's good and treasure up currency, which shall surely save us in time of need.” You have said in your hearts, "We are wise, and we are prosperous; calamity shall not come on us, as it never comes to us, because our God will not let our nation fall; for we are wise and mighty.” Except you are not wise, but wise in your own conceits; and I have given your enemies victory over you.</p>
<p>Oh, man, who will save you from your hour of judgment that is approaching the entire world? Will your leaders save you? Verily, I say not, as the son of perdition comes your way and already openly walks among you, deceiving many with good words and fair speeches. Will your money save you? Nay, all of your treasures will be declared worthless instantly, and there will be no recompense of your life's works which you greedily hoard. Oh, that you had not abandoned the ways of the Lord and had loved your neighbor and helped the needy with your abundance.</p>
<p>But no, you hoard the very abundance God has given you to satisfy your soul. Verily, I have given many of you more than enough for yourselves and to bless your neighbor; but nay, you have said, I shall keep this great abundance to myself because God has surely blessed me on account of my own goodness and strength. Behold, I tell you a thing before it happens, so in your hour of calamity you will then remember my voice and the words of my mouth that I have inspired in my prophets. For I send them not to speak of their own, but I send them as a warning for you, that you may yet save your soul by turning to me, the Lord Jesus Christ, who is able to save you to the uttermost. But you have said in your heart, Salvation? I need not saving, as I am wonderful the way I was born. Yet your sins are a stench in my Father's nostrils, and the land has become rotten on account of your iniquities. Know you not that you were born dead in trespasses and sins, corrupting your very nature?</p>
<p>Though I would give you a new, clean nature, you account my sacrifice worthless and cleave to your rotten flesh.</p>
<p>Take up a lamentation for the people of your once great nation who reject my voice. For great sorrow and travail shall come suddenly on you. There will be a mighty shaking, and my mighty host of heaven will rain great destruction on the great harlot, and she shall never rise again, though a remnant shall be saved. Even in your calamity and destruction that surely approaches will I send my prophets to you. You shall know them by their fruit, words, and healings; many healings and miracles will I do by their hands. Yet, even still many shall perish and die in their sins, yet the meek shall inherit the earth; for my inheritance is with me, ready to distribute to the faithful. How long can I outstretch my hand to a gainsaying people who stand against me and my ways and in their deception declare themselves righteous before God in their own dirty garments?</p>
<p>Repent! Weep and howl over your sins, and cry to me that I may yet save you. Many of your churches have been infiltrated by ravenous wolves who preach to you words that will lead you to your end, and still you will not turn from them and turn to me with open face and heart, as I would save you from your distresses and keep your children safe from the armies of the evil one, who openly walk your streets and are already stealing from you greatly. Their lusts will not be satisfied until they have taken everything from you and mutilated many. But those who call on my name shall be saved if they endure to the end.</p>
<p>Why do you harden your hearts against the Lord of Hosts? Why do you yet lie to your own hearts, saying, "There is no calamity; as it was yesterday, it will be today, and tomorrow brings the same?" You scoffers will reap the reward of your faithless ways, and those who reject me will be brought to utter ruin and great distress. Hear my words, oh, adulterous and evil generation. Hear my words and lean your ear into them to hear every letter I will speak. Great shaking will rend your nation that you esteem so mightily, and from great shaking shall come great destruction. I will lay waste your once great cities and I will even bring the water to cover your sinful coasts; for you love not the Lord but are lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.</p>
<p>I have no pleasure in your judgment, as my grace and mercy has abounded to you for a long period now. Many of those who have defiled Noah's covenant will themselves be covered in the waters for desecrating the holy bow of many colors that my Father gave as a pledge. Fire will rain down on you by the hand of your enemies, and many shall perish in the flames and ensuing toxicity. Your land shall be rent, and great calamity will be your supper, for you have rejected the Lord of Lords and King of Kings.</p>
<p>The evil one has imported his Red Army already in your cities, towns, and villages. They walk among you, plotting your destruction; and they wait on their orders and the departure of my restrainer, whom I will loosen shortly. They will mop up and destroy and subjugate what remains. Not only that, but they will claim it as their own, and they will carry many of you off into their camps which they have already prepared. Many will lose their heads for my name's sake, and I will reward them richly when they stay faithful to the end. There will be no light; there will be fallen bridges and overturned roads. Who will supply you food and water when your nation lies waste never to rise again? But I will still yet save a remnant, and a remnant will I yet save, for I have declared it!</p>
<p>Fear not, my people and my faithful ones. I will snatch you from the midst in the twinkling of an eye into my Father's house, where I have prepared a place and a table for you that we may sup together, my children. I long for your presence, and soon you will see my face with your own eyes, and you will have the reward of your faith in me because you have faith in your heart when you have not even seen with your own eyes my glory, nor the glory of my Father, who is greater than I. And I have called you and chosen you as my own, and never will you depart from me, as you will evermore be with your Lord and redeemer. Know that I will reward you richly and shower you with blessings that you simply cannot comprehend at this time. Stay faithful yet till the end, for a short time and these things shall come to pass; verily, the hour is late, and the night has already fallen on the earth.</p>
<div class="indent">
<p>I am the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, and a name has been given me above every name, that at the name of Jesus Christ should all heaven and earth bow the knee.</p>
<p>I am the Prince of Peace, and outside of me there is no peace.</p>
<p>I am he who has given you rest, that you may rest in me and find shelter in my grace.</p>
<p>I am he who walks among the seven candlesticks, who commands my Father's angels, and all things in heaven and earth are in my hands, as my Father gave them to me in my victory over the evil one until my enemies be made my footstool.</p>
<p>I am your Lord and your redeemer, and I am the good shepherd that has been crowned with all glory, and I hold life eternal in my hands for those who will but humble themselves and ask.</p>
</div>
<p>Declare me Lord! Fear not, my little children, as it is the last times and a great multitude shall be saved out of the coming tribulation. Whosoever calls on the name of Jesus Christ shall be saved, and I will heal them and reward them for their faithfulness. Truly, I walk among you, and what great thing has the Lord planned that he has not told his prophets before they come to pass? I tell you plainly, hearken to my voice, as very little time remains before the sound of the last trump. Even the angels stand ready in the heavens above, waiting on the trumpet blast! Your full redemption is at your door, so fear not and cleave to me, for your life is hid in me and is about to be revealed.</p>
