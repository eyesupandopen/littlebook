<h1 id="ph">To the 144,000: Hear My Words and Wisdom!</h1>
<div id="prophecy"> 
<p>Hear my words and incline your ear to my wisdom, for I, the Lord Jesus Christ, will speak with you if you will hear my words. For I will seal my 144,000; have you not read? And I saw another Angel ascending from the East, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four Angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, saying, hurt not the earth, neither the sea nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads. And so I will send those whom I will seal, and you shall do mighty works for me, and you will walk in great power. But this will not be as in the age of grace, where preachers in pulpits taught from the holy writings. (Some spoke falsely and some did mighty works for me in their churches.) The church age is coming to a close, and my age of grace is nearly completed, and so the times of testing will begin, even Jacob's trouble.</p>
<p>And so I will send you to tend to my flock that will be further scattered and tested by calamity after calamity. For the days will be evil, and you will shine as lights and stand as pillars among the scattered. And so I send you to love and care for your neighbor. For you who are faithful to my calling will live the law I have given, not the law of Moses. For I, Yeshua HaMashiach, have fulfilled the law of Moses, and Torah is kept by faith in me, for the just shall live by faith.</p>
<p>And so it shall be: Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, and love your neighbor as yourself. For in so doing these things you will surely save your soul from destruction as well as those to whom I send you. These are not the times of long lives and prosperity, for those days have passed from the earth until I come to rule the earth in righteousness. He who loves not his life until the end shall be saved and live eternally.</p>
<p>You are alive in times of war, and great wrath, and great revelation of all things. For the great eternal God, even Yahweh, will conceal himself no longer from the earth; for he will break forth from his abode, and he is sending me, even Yeshua HaMashiach, to fulfill his wrath and fulfill his promises he made to the Fathers. But first, judgment will fall, and great wrath will fall on the world, and you will no longer be able to participate in their society. For participation in their society that will rise from the ashes will require everyone to receive their mark. If you join them, you will share in their eternal damnation in that great lake of fire, and that lake was prepared by God for the Devil and his angels, so join them not.</p>
<p>You will find no peace in their rising world but only unrestrained evil, for I will have removed the restrainer. And if you are not part of their hive mind, then you will have no part with them, for they will kill all who dissent. For the mark will forever alter those who accept by altering their very DNA, for mankind was made in the image of Yahweh, though Satan seeks to blasphemously alter that image irrevocably through his pharmaceuticals which are peddled in great lies. They will promise you long life, peace, and prosperity, but those lies are simply bait. For once the mark is taken, nothing will undo the damage, for Yahweh has so declared!</p>
<p>For the servant is not greater than his master, and I am calling you to works where I will lead you step by step, and as in the days of Noah, so shall it be. And so I, Yeshua HaMashiach, fulfilled my purpose as the lamb of God, for I offered my sinless blood to Yahweh of my own free will choice and on account of the perfect love that burns in my heart.</p>
<p>And so for the joy that was set before me, I endured great trouble, torment, and anguish, (even unjustly) because I took all the consequences of all the sins of mankind onto myself. And I paid for every sin, fully, and I did it willingly. So look unto me, Jesus, the author and finisher of your faith, who for the joy that was set before me, endured the cross, and despised the shame, and am set at the right hand of the throne of God. So follow my example to great victory, for even in the wilderness I will make your path plain.</p>
<p>So understand, there will be no peace, and I send you to minister in a time of great war and trouble. For the dragon will make war on the saints and will overcome them, for so has he been empowered to accomplish. And those who call on the name of the Lord will be saved, for those who love not their lives until the end will find their lives eternally in me, Christ Jesus. For I have atoned for the sins of mankind in my sinless blood, and I am the high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek, who has offered my sinless blood to Yahweh once and for all. Therefore, do not return to the old ways, nor their traditions, nor their Talmud, nor the Torah; for Torah is kept fully by faith in me, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>And so through great troubles, great pains, great struggles, shall my holy ones shine, and great will be their reward, for great is my reward. For what says the promise: These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore, are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his Temple: and he that sits on the Throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore, neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.</p>
<p>And so I will send those whom I have called. I am calling you to love God with your whole heart, soul, mind, and strength, and am sending you to love your neighbor as yourself. For survival will come from life-giving words my Father has given for obedience by all. And so love your neighbor, care for one another, help and sustain one another; for my people will be scattered. They will gather in communities in the wilderness, and though the wilderness will not be safe, I will provide refuge for my people and will provide sustenance for their needs.</p>
<p>And so I will send those whom I have called. I am sending you to command the impossible as you walk in love and great power, even the power I will clothe you with. For you will walk for me step by step many times in obedience, as you rely on me, Christ Jesus, who will lead you by my spirit; and the anointing you have will cause you to walk victoriously. But it will come to pass as scripture says: Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth, yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors, and their works do follow them.</p>
<p>Step by step will you walk, and I will lead you in such manner. For I am your refuge and fortress, even your true Messiah in whom you will trust. And though a thousand shall fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand: but it shall not come near you. For you are sealed to fulfill my purposes, and great reward and promise I have given you to sustain and strengthen you, for I am sending you in the works my Father has ordained of me, and so I send you as my ministers and prophets.</p>
<p>So as you go to command the impossible, know that you will command much by the spirit born within you. So command the mountains to be removed and cast into the sea, as you have faith in Yahweh. So command the spirits to depart as you speak mighty words with great faith in Yahweh. So command all sickness and pestilence to depart as you speak words that must be obeyed (even by all things) as you speak words of great power with great faith in Yahweh. For by Yahweh's own plans and purposes have I been sent, and in those plans and purposes I am sending you, and you will do mighty works for me. For Yahweh is all in all by my spirit, with which I will seal the chosen.</p>
<p>For in me, Yeshua HaMashiach, all fullness dwells, for the Father has given me all things in heaven and earth, so I may fulfill all. And so Yahweh is all in all, and you have access to the Father and to his Son, for thus Moses taught: The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me, unto him ye shall hearken. I am that prophet of whom Moses has spoken (even raised up from the tribe of Judah), and I am so much more; for the Father has determined that I, Yeshua HaMashiach, should have all preeminence, and in me all fullness should dwell. I am that prophet of whom Moses has spoken, even raised from the dead for such a purpose.</p>
<p>And so I will provide for you and for those to whom I will send you. For you will be a beacon of light, even hidden in plain sight in a dark and unstable world. You will preach all things pertaining to me, your Lord and savior, for I am the lamb of God, even the perfect Passover. There is salvation in no other name except mine, even Jesus Christ the Righteous.</p>
<p>Some of you I will take from place to place, and you will be my spokesman, prophets, and ministers. You will need to test the spirits of those you encounter and walk in great wisdom; for the world you have known will be replaced with a lawless world of many wastelands, and some of you will be sent to minster to those in the wastelands, and you will understand my instructions, and you will do great exploits.</p>
<p>And so understand that after the war and destruction that is to occur after I gather my faithful (and remove the restrainer), there will be much chaos and destruction. People will run to and fro, and many will perish in faithless unbelief, and they will hunt and capture and kill many. And for many, the first voice they will hear will not be mine, though that voice will offer false salvation. No, even the beast who will rise in great power from the dragon will falsely call many to their eternal end of which there is no hope.</p>
<p>They will all pretend, for they are great pretenders, and they will pretend that they are the true Messiah, and their followers will claim to represent the true Messiah and the true God; but I have not sent them, so do not follow their false beacons of hope. For they will offer entrance into their new society to build their new world; but to enter, one must take the mark. And to those who take the mark, entrance will be granted into the fiery flames of blue in that great lake of fire burning with brimstone. For all who take the mark will have their part in the fires that are unquenchable and will have exchanged eternal life for a morsel of bread in the ways of Esau.</p>
<p>You will need to ignore all voices but mine and depart from all those who reject me. It will take great wisdom, skill, and cunning to survive, and I will give you the tongue of the wise that you may know how to answer every man. For I will make plain my voice to you, though it is but a still, small voice. You will know my voice, for I will confirm my voice to you many times over, so be not faithless but have great faith in my words of promise.</p>
<p>I will teach you all things, and you will know how to do the works I am sending you to accomplish. My voice is a perfect voice, even the voice of one crying in the wilderness, and I am speaking through the voice of one who cries in the wilderness; for so have they been sent, even my prophets and ministers who have gone ahead to make your paths straight and your ways plain. I have ordained many mighty works for you, and you will do mightily.</p>
<p>Therefore, know my tribes, kinsman, and children of promise: the harvest truly is great, but the laborers are few; pray you therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth laborers into his harvest. Go your ways: Behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves. For I am the Lord of Harvest, and though the laborers have always been few, there is great reward and eternal profit and glory for the work you will do. For you will reap much reward and fruit in me; only faint not at your tribulations and troubles. This is the final separation, and all who are ordained to eternal life from before the foundations of the World will be found, and they will never be lost, for nobody is able to pluck them from my hand.</p>
<p>And so your works will follow into eternity, and in your many exploits you will glorify Yahweh, who has sent me, Yeshua HaMashiach, as your true Messiah. And by your many mighty accomplishments and many salted words of truth that you will speak, you will announce my soon return and go in the works of John the Baptist to prepare for the coming of the Lord: so announce my return, for I will surely fulfill my words of promise. For verily at the end of Jacob's trouble, even at the end of the last week of years, even Daniel's seventieth week, I will return with the armies in heaven to establish my Kingdom on Earth, even the Kingdom of God; and my thousand year reign will commence, even a reign of righteousness, holiness, and peace as the Lion will lie down with the Lamb!</p>
