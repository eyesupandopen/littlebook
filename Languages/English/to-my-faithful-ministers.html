<h1 id="ph">To My Faithful Ministers: I Commission you!</h1>
<div id="prophecy">
<p>To my faithful ministers and to those who have left Laodicea!</p>
<p>My Bride, hear my voice and come to me, that I may yet soothe your wounds and strengthen you in my might. Fear not! My anger is not on you, for I will say to you: Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of your lord. For I have harsh words, words of chastisement, for the disobedient; but that particular chastisement is not directed at you because you are faithful, though you should still take heed to my words, lest you fall.</p>
<p>My faithful Bride, you are the apple of my eye, and there is no condemnation toward you, for you are in Christ, and you have built your lives on me, Jesus Christ, even the chief cornerstone that the false builders have rejected. Continue to stay faithful in me, for I am coming to you in great power, for the consummation of the age is at hand. I am sending you in great power and in works you never imagined for yourselves, for you didn't know you were born into the mystery of God at your first breath, but you have grown mightily in my grace, and you now see. For my grace is a powerful grace that cannot be overcome, and my mercies are from everlasting to everlasting.</p>
<p>Behold! says Yeshua HaMashiach. Listen to me and inscribe my words on the fleshly tables of your hearts. For I am sending you; yes, I am commissioning you with these words, and those I commission will receive undeniable confirmation of my passionate will. I am sending you in the works of my great ones, works they started many jubilees ago, and those works continue to this day. For the book of Acts is not finished being written until my Bride is with me. Then you will understand the fullness from the books in the heavens, for your individual exploits are inscribed therein, and we will all rejoice at your faithfulness before Yahweh himself, for he rejoices with us and is in you all.</p>
<p>Behold! I send some of you in the ministry of Paul as stewards of my mysteries and as apostles to the nations. Behold! I send some of you in the spirit of Elijah to stand against Jezebel, the false prophetess, and to prophesy for me, Christ Jesus! Behold! I send some of you in the work of Philip the evangelist, where I will take you from place to place with the words of my gospel on your lips, tailored to the needs of the unsaved, for you will save them by preaching the cross! Behold! I send some of you in the work of Peter, for he tended my flock and fed them the pure word of God. For the slothful Laodicean ministers feed my flock junk food, even faithless words of no power. Behold! I have made you teachers so that you may teach and instruct my people in the ways of righteousness, for you will teach them as I lead! For you will shepherd them as I lead! For you will evangelize them as I lead! For my prophets will speak the words I give, unchanged in meaning and heart! For my apostles will shine the light of my glorious good news of the great mystery of God, so the veil of Moses can be removed from your hearts. For the Corinthian witness cries aloud! But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart. Nevertheless, when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. Now the Lord is that spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the spirit of the Lord. I, Christ Jesus, remove your veil!</p>
<p>Behold, I send you in these last minutes before your gathering to me at my appearing. I need you to hear my voice and follow my instructions, as you faithfully do, my faithful Bride, for you are faithful! Go not in the work I am sending you in your own understanding. Go not in the work I am sending you in your own power. Go not in the work I am sending you in your own ability. Go not in the work I am sending you in your own strength. Hear my words with your entire heart! For I, even I, Christ Jesus the glorified Lord, say to you: I am your understanding, and I am your power, and I am your strength, and I am your ability: only doubt not!</p>
<p>Do the works I will lead you to accomplish, and care for the people I send you. Will you condescend to men of low estate? Will you sit with, preach to, save, and fellowship with the homeless? For I am sending some of you for that purpose. Will you entreat the Laodicean ministers in humility as one would a Father? For so are my ways. Will you speak the words I give you, even if you don't fully understand or agree? (Confirm my words with scripture.) For I am sending you to do my will, not your own. Will you shepherd the flock in the healing powers of the fire in your spirit I will kindle in you? (And when the chief shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a crown of glory that fades not away.) Do my works, my Bride, and cease from your own works, for there is no more time, and the lamps will soon go out.</p>
<p>Understand, I am sending you in my work, and you will reap great reward if you are faithful, for you already have many treasures laid up in the heavens, and many mansions in my Father's house are readied for you. For Jacob's trouble is seven days of seven years, where each year is reckoned a day. So too is the wedding of the Bridegroom to his Bride. For there will be seven days of seven years in the heavens, where each year is reckoned a day, and you will ever be with me, my Bride. Then we ride!</p>
<p>Go your ways and go the way I am leading you. Submit yourselves in love and humility one to another. Tend to my garden, for I have planted a garden of eternal life that the evil one cannot pluck up nor destroy. You will eat from the very tree of life he has failed at keeping you from, and there is no life abundant in Satan's lake of fire, where he is going, but only punishment, regret, shame, and torment. These things are not for you, my Bride, and the second death has no power on you, for you have gone from death to life in me, even Jesus Christ, your savior and Lord.</p>
<p>So go where I send you, and work with the people I am sending you to, and I am sending to you. For they are not coming to you by accident, but because I have already started directing them to you. Live my mystery and live as they did in Acts, for you are the last chapter that is being written as you live for me, and soon you will see when you are in the heavens once I snatch you away to myself, for you are mine! You are my bride, my glorious Church, whom I will make to myself, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing: but that you should be holy and without blame, for I have cleansed you in my atoning blood!</p>
<p>I am calling you, my Bride, and I am calling you into ministries you never dreamed you could accomplish, for the Laodicean ministers tried to make you sit in darkness. Don't run from the power I am kindling in you, for the hand of the Lord, even my hand of blessing, is upon you. Do not run from my ministries that I am kindling in your spirit. For I will kindle a great blaze in your spirit, my Bride, a fire that will melt away all things holding you back. Fear not! Walk in my power, for the faithless Laodicean ministers have tried to convince you that you are powerless, and there is serious consequence for them should they not repent.</p>
<p>Behold! I am sending you into the works where others have failed, and you will go in their stead, for you are faithful: Only destroy your pride, lest you fall victim to evil as they have. Hold not your tongues, for I have loosened them. Speak the words I have given you, and go before me in great power. Do you think I am a respecter of persons? For now is a time of special miracles, as I recorded in Acts: And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul: So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them. My Bride of great faith, finish for me the works I am calling you to, for we are consummating my purposes in you, and the sun is setting on my age of grace, and soon night will fall fully on the world, for you are leaving. Behold! I, Jesus Christ, will do many mighty miracles, even special miracles by your hand, for this is the final great commissioning for my Church before you are snatched away in glory.</p>
<p>Go, in peace, and I will guide. Know that you will be greatly resisted by friend, family, and foe alike. These are the times of separation when I am pruning the unfaithful and purging my olive tree of their faithless ways, for they have not made themselves ready for the bridegroom, and they will take their places with the foolish virgins. And I am purging my faithful of sin so that they can bring forth new branches that bear much fruit. Fear not, thinking you are unworthy of miracles. For I agree, of your own selves none of you can do miracles; but I will grant many signs, wonders, and miracles at the hands of my faithful. Go and say to the mountains, be removed and cast into the sea, and doubt not but have faith in Yahweh, and Me, Yeshua HaMashiach.</p>
<p>There is no spiritual hammer to swing, so cease from your own efforts. For you can walk on water if you keep your eyes on me and doubt not and look not to the left or the right but stay your eyes on me, and you will not sink. Command the spirits, for they are in subjection to me and therefore are in subjection to you. Command the spirits to depart; don't ask, but command! Don't allow them to speak, but silence them; don't talk with them, for their words are poison; but cast them out into the wilderness where they have no house, and soon they will be cast into the fire. Heal the sick! Speak to the sickness in my name, and tell it to leave; fear not, for I will give you the words. Fear not! You don't have to speak eloquent words; just speak words of faith that I will inspire your hearts and doubt not.</p>
<p>Behold! Go forth for me, my Bride, doubting nothing. I am inviting you into the works I am finishing, of which many of you are already my fellow laborers. There are still yet souls to save, even the ones whom Satan is trying to hide. I will break them free from his bonds through your many mighty works and exploits that we will do together. Go forth, my Bride, doubting nothing, for I have prepared you your entire lives for these few moments of power and obedience, and you have been well trained by me, and those I have sent to care for your souls.</p>
<p>My faithful Bride, I love you, and you are my joy and rejoicing. I smile over you daily, yet you don't see me with your own eyes, and you still have faith. I cry over your hurts, though I cry in silence many times. I hear your cries for help, and I am an ever-present help in time of need. I love you and care for you, and you are the apple of my eye, and soon we will be together. I know you are weary, for you have been faithful to my Word and my name, so I will strengthen you in the strength of the unlimited and eternal God, even Yahweh, for there is none like him! Faint not, for even though your flesh may be weary, I will strengthen you in my might, for I, Yeshua HaMashiach, have declared it!</p>

<p>I am coming to you in great power.</p>
<p>I am sending you in great power.</p>
<p>I am calling you, my Bride, into ministries you didn't know you had until now.</p>
<p>I am sending some of you to complete the works of the unfaithful, and you will have their reward.</p>
<p>I am pruning the unfaithful.</p>

<p>Go your way, and stand in the Temple, and speak to the people all the words of this life. For you are the temple of the living God!</p>
