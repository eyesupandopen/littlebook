<h1 id="ph">To the 144,000: Repudiate Their Lies</h1>
<div id="prophecy"> 
<p>Incline your ears to my voice and hear my wisdom, for wisdom cries aloud in the streets: will you hear my voice? I am Yeshua HaMashiach, even the son of Yahweh, who came in the flesh and am the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. Understand that the world in which you live is not the false portrait your Jesuit educators painted to lead you astray. Many of you have been indoctrinated into Jesuit lies, even learning against learning. This war on truth was designed to mold the minds of men into submission to Satan and endeavors to remove and usurp man's free will so that man would mindlessly follow his indoctrination.</p>
<p>True history cannot be understood from the lies of Jesuit philosophers, for they are liars peddling falsehood in great deceit. Scripture is clear on the matter, and Romans declares the truth plainly stated: For the wrath of God appears from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, which withhold the truth in unrighteousness.</p>
<p>Did you let those words reach your heart? Men purposely withhold the truth in ungodliness and unrighteousness, and the wrath of Yahweh is against those who do. So your educations are made spurious by their lies.</p>
<p>They have done this to prepare the way for the coming great deception, and so that Satan's kingdom can be unleashed to rule in great deception and lies. The lies they have told you for education serve to blind the masses to the truth: There are no aliens, only fallen angels headed for the lake of fire to be bound and burned for eternity. Believe not their lies and run to me, Christ Jesus, for in me dwells the all truth that will make you free. I tell you these things so you will not be deceived with those who will join Satan and receive the coming beastly mark.</p>
<p>History is understood by following truths established in Scripture and extra-Biblical books 1 Enoch, Jasher, Jubilees, et al., from the beginning. For these ungodly men and the lies they use to obscure the truth are simply part of the great war, even the seed war between Yahweh and Satan that rages to this very minute, yet is won for all eternity by my atoning works. For war was declared by Yahweh on that old serpent for his rebellion, even from the beginning of creation of mankind when Satan tried to destroy Adam and Eve. Yahweh stated to the serpent in his declaration: I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed: it shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel. And so the seed wars have raged ever since.</p>
<p>In the Garden of Eden, Satan managed to corrupt the seed of Adam, condemning Adam under the power and corruption of sin. (In this thing the son of God appeared, that he would undo the works of the devil.) For Satan used his corrupt knowledge of good and evil to utterly corrupt mankind, and for those who obey my voice, that corruption is undone in me, Christ Jesus, in whom you are a new creation that can never be corrupted. My seed cannot be corrupted, for Yahweh has made it incorruptible, and by way of the new birth I have sealed my chosen and faithful even with that holy spirit of promise!</p>
<p>John in his first letter declares the eternal truth: Whosoever is born of God does not commit sin: for his seed remains in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.</p>
<p>In a short time after the fall of Eden, where Adam sinned and fell from perfection to corruption, the watchers descended on Mount Hermon in the days of Jared. And they all bound themselves by mutual imprecations, even their unholy oath whereby they bound themselves eternally to sin and eternal punishment. They did so in order that they would all take to themselves wives of all they chose, thus changing the order of their nature.</p>
<p>They came to mankind offering their putrid fallen-angel knowledge, for they joined the Satan's rebellion.</p>
<p>They taught men to make swords, and knives, and shields, and breastplates, and made known to them the metals of the earth and the art of working them, and bracelets, and ornaments, and the use of antimony, and the beautifying of the eyelids, and all kinds of costly stones, and all coloring tinctures. They taught enchantments, and root-cuttings, the resolving of enchantments, astrology, the constellations, the knowledge of the clouds, the signs of the earth, the signs of the sun, and the course of the moon.</p>
<p>So the fallen watchers took their wives and committed fornication with them, and they became pregnant and bore to them great giants. And in time this unholy seed devoured all that was on the earth, and all that was given to mankind, and eventually devoured as much of mankind as they could. For they were blood drinkers and man eaters, and they did great evil in the sight of Yahweh, for the life of the flesh is in the blood and mankind was made in the image of Yahweh. They grew and multiplied and eventually set up their kingdoms across the face of the earth. Behold! The ruins of their megalithic structures still litter the earth as a witness against them. They dominated the earth during those times, and they were made for mankind's destruction. And so all manners of abominations were achieved, for the holy writings even declare how it was accomplished.</p>
<p>As if it wasn't enough for mankind to lust after strange flesh, fornicate with fallen angels, and produce giant offspring, because of the watchers they all sinned against birds, and beasts, and reptiles, and fish. From the beginning of creation, Yahweh ordained each life form after its kind. But the evil watchers tampered with creation, even crossing creatures of one kind with creatures of a similar kind to introduce genetic instability and alter Yahweh's initial creation of harmonious perfection. This process was repeated, crossing similar creatures of one kind with similar creatures of another kind until the desired outcome was achieved. And so the world that then was, became corrupted with all sorts of malevolent abominations who sinned greatly against Yahweh, mankind, and all creation. Understand, the fallen ones want a world of their own, even a world of darkness completely separate from Yahweh, and they will inherit just that in the lake of fire prepared for them by Yahweh himself.</p>
<p>And so the days of Noah came and the world that then was, standing out of the water and in the water, was overflowed with water and perished. For the fountains of the great deep were broken up, causing great violence as the earth was broken apart by the forceful might of the violent waters, and the windows of heaven were opened, allowing waters from above the firmament (and from beneath the earth) to cover and destroy the entire world.</p>
<p>And so Enoch the scribe describes the fate of these giants as such, for Yahweh so declared: And now, the giants, who are produced from the spirits and flesh, shall be called evil spirits upon the earth, and on the earth shall be their dwelling. Evil spirits have proceeded from their bodies; because they are born from men, from the holy watchers is their beginning and primal origin; they shall be evil spirits on earth, and evil spirits shall they be called. As for the spirits of heaven, in heaven shall be their dwelling, but as for the spirits of the earth which were born upon the earth, on the earth shall be their dwelling. And the spirits of the giants afflict, oppress, destroy, attack, do battle, and work destruction on the earth, and cause trouble: they take no food, but nevertheless hunger and thirst, and cause offenses. And these spirits shall rise up against the children of men and against the women, because they have proceeded from them. Understand that nine-tenths of these evil spirits are in the abyss due to Noah's petition and prayer, and mankind has only dealt with one-tenth of them ever since. That is about to change when the abyss will be opened and all will be released.</p>
<p>So the earth, and all the watchers' abominations, were destroyed. The watchers themselves were chained in their various judgments for seventy generations, to be released for judgment in the time of the great judgment. (For the great judgment is about to begin.) However, Noah found grace in Yahweh's sight because he was a righteous man, and his family Yahweh saved alive even eight souls total, along with many other creatures on the Ark. Noah kept himself and his family from genetic tampering before the flood. But his son Ham and his evil offspring would eventually reject Noah and even Yahweh himself (who had created and saved them), joining themselves to the Satan's rebellion.</p>
<p>The words of Genesis 6 were fulfilled by the sins of Noah's offspring, even the line of Ham. There were giants in the earth in those days: and also after that. "Those days" were the days from Jared to Noah, and "giants in the earth" were the offspring of the watchers and daughters of men before the flood. "After that" is after the days of Noah, when mankind's genetics were again corrupted by fallen-angel knowledge. I ask you to no longer believe the deception of the erroneous Sethite theory and believe the words of the holy writing, for these words are truth.</p>
<p>When the earth was divided by lot among Noah's sons (Shem, Ham, and Japheth), Ham's lot was for him to inherit the lands to the south, and so they were his. However, Canaan lusted after a portion of Shem's inheritance and moved into lands that were not his to occupy. For it was Canaan that Noah cursed. For Canaan left his inheritance and founded the city of Tyre on what became the Phoenician coast and led to Sidon, of which Jezebel descended. He did this so that he could be in proximity to Mount Hermon, where the watchers descended and where I was transfigured.</p>
<p>Canaan found what the watchers left behind before the flood of Noah, because they sought to preserve their rebellion even after the flood, for they carved much into rocks and stones. Canaan used their fallen-angel knowledge in great sorceries, and many vile rites were done by the Canaanite, for they even sacrificed their own children. So vile were they and so pervasive that he managed to infect the land of Canaan with his newly made abominations, where Satan worked on account of his transgressions.</p>
<p>And so the tribes of post-flood giants, even the abominable Canaanite tribes, arose from Canaan's transgressions and iniquities and sorceries. To the land Canaan stole from Shem came the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites. They were the terrible ones, even Rephaim. There were more tribes than listed, but these terrible ones were waiting in the land of promise in an effort to kill those who protected the Christ line, even your Israelite ancestors and fathers who were Hebrews.</p>
<p>Joshua entered the promised land to claim what was rightfully given to Shem by lot and the land that rightfully belonged to Israel by promise of Yahweh himself. But the children of Israel did not fully carry out the commands of Yahweh to leave none of the tares alive, for they were malevolent and not human, and their practices were vile, and they did much evil in the sight of Yahweh, for so was their nature. And so Yahweh told Israel as recorded in scripture: But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then it shall come to pass that those which you let remain of them, shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell. And it was so.</p>
<p>History in part shows the propagation and movement of these abominations, even the tares planted by Satan himself, as they have lived among the wheat since the days of old. They have set up many civilizations using their technologies and fallen-angel knowledge; they are master builders, they are sorcerers, many of them have unnatural abilities, and they are connected to their father the Devil, even sharing his characteristics and lusts. These tares have infiltrated every aspect of society, and not all of them are giants. Many appear human, except they are hybrid creatures forever altered from Yahweh's designs in creation and will not be redeemed. Fear them not, for greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.</p>
<p>These tares seek to take what belongs by inheritance and promise to the children of God. There can be no accord with them, for they are of their father the Devil, and the lusts of their father they will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and when he speaks a lie he speaks of his own, for he is a liar and the father of it. They will absolutely subvert, pollute, destroy, kill, pillage, plunder, and do their worst against anything godly that they set their lusts on. They have no peace, and their nature is utterly corrupt. They have subverted the world, and they will set up their kingdom for one hour as the dragon has his reign on the earth. Yet they seek to re-establish their golden age, but no golden age will they have but harsh judgment, and they shall not escape.</p>
<p>These evil tares have corrupted knowledge, learning, history, religion, science, and on and on they have corrupted. They have propagated fallen angel technology and there is nothing new under the sun. As the times have been fulfilled, they have utterly covered the earth in lies, and the entire world lies in wickedness. By their enlightenment, the Jesuit tares have utterly corrupted society and led mankind into a sea of lies, where the only escape is by repentance and repudiation from all the sins and lies. (For Rome made Islam as well; study to learn.) Their fallen angel knowledge and lies stand against scriptural history and instead offer flimsy fables that blind the minds and hearts of men. Therefore, come out from among them and be ye separate.</p>
<p>The world today is one where many, many people have collective amnesia as a result of Jesuit indoctrination. Many of you have forgotten not only Yahweh's covenants and ways, but utterly forgotten who you are and who your ancestors truly are. This was done by design through war, lies, and re-population efforts over the years that have scattered so many to the four corners of the earth. Of this they willingly are ignorant that it is impossible to hide anything from Yahweh's sight; and I, Yeshua HaMashiach, know my own and whom I am calling to salvation.</p>
<p>Some of those who were scattered were orphans and taken from their families either through war or outright kidnapping. These souls grew up on fake history, even being lied to with romanticized notions of a false past, and so the delusion is rooted deeply in the hearts of men, and many are forever blinded by lies that are accepted as truth. But for those who turn to me, Yeshua HaMashiach, you will know the truth and the truth shall make you free. Your present society is built on the ruins and ashes of the fallen ones' civilizations of old, and great effort has gone into concealing the truth. That which has been shall be again, and there is nothing new under the sun.</p>
<p>Without my atoning sacrifice and my offer of salvation, you would all be lost. So come to me, Yeshua HaMashiach, and I will guide you into all truth and I will teach you your true history. I will reconnect you with your true ancestry, for many of you are from the land, though salvation is for all nations. I will teach you in the ways of holiness, and you will live righteously by faith in me, Jesus Christ, and you will live eternally. There is nothing secret that will not come to light, and all will be exposed fully, that the truth may be known by all.</p>
<p>So quit feasting on lies as you bury yourselves in complacency, for the times of complacency are over. The times of revealing are at hand. For behold! As in the days of Noah, so shall it be. Satan has used his tapestry of lies to set the stage for his great end-time deceptions, and most of the world will follow his lies. For the entirety of the devil's kingdom will be set free from the abyss, and giants will once again live among men, for they are coming to fulfill Yahweh's wrath.</p>
<p>Satan tells great lies, and these fallen ones will claim they are from other worlds and that they are advanced above mankind by many thousands of years. They will come offering seemingly benevolent knowledge, and they will cloak themselves in false benevolence. But these are of Satan's kingdom, so do not fall for the deceptions. Do not follow the ways of the world, for the world will wonder after Satan's kingdom, even saying, who is like unto the beast?</p>
<p>I will hide you away, I will protect you, I will strengthen you, I will guide you step by step, and I will utterly tear down the veil of lies that has covered the world in deceit. I, even Yeshua HaMashiach, will empower and cause you to do many mighty wonders in this time of Jacob's trouble. And so I tell you these things, so the truth will make you free, and that so you may be free indeed and not fall for their great deception. For its foundations are lies, deceit, and falsehood propagated by the seed of the serpent.</p>
