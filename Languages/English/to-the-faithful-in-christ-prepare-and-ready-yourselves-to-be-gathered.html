<h1 id="ph">To the Faithful in Christ: Prepare and Ready Yourselves to be Gathered, Your Bridegroom Draws Near!</h1>
<div id="prophecy"> 
<p>Hear, hear the Word of Yeshua HaMashiach and bow your hearts in obedience to the sound of my Words! And so it is, that many of my people have turned to the right and many more have turned to the left, even away from Christ Jesus their Lord, even as I am coming to gather you to myself should you remain faithful to my voice in all obedience to my Words. Because, truly, truly, I am your true Lord, King, High Priest, and Messiah! Yes, I am calling you all into my loving arms to be gathered to me so suddenly and unexpectedly now, even all those who obediently wait in full faith, and especially all those who have fallen away to this deception intended by Heylel Ben Shachar to deceive the hearts of the simple, and crush your righteous expectations of righteous and complete redemption, even your full redemption that will overtake the faithful in Christ, so suddenly and unexpectedly now!</p>
<p>Even lying words given falsely by false prophets who are date setters, even speaking falsely in the name of Jesus Christ, even claiming they speak for me! Yet they do not speak my Words, nor produce my fruit, and neither do they know me, and I will say to all who falsely claim such things on that great day: “Depart from me you workers of iniquity, I never knew you!” And so it is, that many of the faithful in Christ who are my church my body, and even my bride now sits sad in disappointment, even as their Bridegroom does approach as announced, declared and promised! Yet so many of you now sit in silence even as if the great gathering of the faithful in Christ can be turned off, or even cancelled by Heylel Ben Shachar, for truly, truly, it is he who falsely scheduled the departing of the faithful in Christ and so many of my faithful ate his lying words greedily as if these lying words are from Christ Jesus himself! Hear my Words my church my body and even my bride! Do you not know my voice? Do you not recognize my Words? For not even a one yod, nor thorn of a yod will pass until all things are fulfilled EXACTLY as written and promised.</p>
<p>Yet so it is, that many of you now sit downcast, and broken hearted in your disobedience, even so that you now sit downcast in subjection to the words of scoffers and mockers, whose judgment will overtake them so suddenly and unexpectedly now and many, many of these will fall to eternal judgment, and will never be given the honor to call on the name of Jesus until their ends, because salvation through martyrdom is a privilege and honor given to those who are heirs of everlasting and eternal life who will come to great reward for their stand, and I will receive them to myself eternally and forevermore in my love for them, and yet it is my faithful Bride who will come to be admired by all in that day! Therefore, stand fast my Bride and salt yourselves to my Words, even the Words of The Everlasting Gospel that I have given into the earth to ready you my loves, therefore bind the Words of the testimony of my messenger and servant tightly to your hearts, knowing that these pure Words are given directly from Yahweh, in the face of Christ Jesus, and I do release them in understanding at my command as I perfectly and accurately reveal them into the heart of my messenger, even from whence I have sewn them, even preserved to be released at my command, and truly my Words are given in all truth and accuracy. Selah.</p>
<p>Truly, truly, as it is: Heylel Ben Shachar, in great hate, actively seeks to overthrow the faith of all those whose faith can be overthrown by his lying words and sneaky deceptions, even all those whose faith is not fully on that true rock of foundation, even Christ Jesus, but rather focused in disobedience on the lying words of sinful men, who neither know Christ Jesus nor neither serve me in the least, but rather lying Heylel Ben Shachar. And by their lying words and fruits of unrighteousness you should know them; but many of my faithful still have itching ears wherewith you desire them to be tickled with lying and falsely soothing words, even lying words Christ Jesus did not send, nor endorse, and neither will I ever send not one lying word to contradict my Holy writings, nor will I ever speak one word contrary to established scripture that I have given, because truly, truly, I am the Word of YHVH, the Great I AM made flesh, and I have been made a life giving spirit, and I will never contradict myself in the least, though they lie. Therefore, I do command you in all authority to hold my Words tightly in your hearts with freshly salted commitment to recover yourselves for your unfaithfulness, even that all of you who believed these lying words can repent and confess them to me, that I may cleanse you fully in my atoning blood and that you may be fully readied for my appearing that is upon you so suddenly and unexpectedly now, even while the rest of the world retreats from Christ Jesus, who would save them to the uttermost. Even as they retreat in full commitment to the image of a false martyr designed and given to mark out those who will attain salvation by the refiners fire, because this is the start of the war on the saints that is about to be released fully for the salvation of the disobedient who are still in bondage to sin, that the flesh may fall to destruction, that truly the spirit may be saved, Selah.</p>
<p>Truly truly, I am Christ Jesus, even Yeshua HaMashiach, and I do come to soothe the wounds of the disobedient amongst my faithful, even all who would allow themselves to be turned from my Words of The Everlasting Gospel, even Words given by my apostles and prophets at the start of this age of grace, even true Words that revealed my mysteries in their times of revealing, even Words that are as true today as when they were first given by me into the ears of those present, but especially my disciples from whom my apostles arose: Take heed: watch, and pray: for you know not when the time is.</p>
<p>Yet so many of you allow false words that contradict my true Words of promise, even words designed to overthrow your faith by building false expectations on a date I have not given, even which expectations are then crushed purposefully to drown you in unfulfilled expectations by those who would trouble you, even all those who come to you in great dishonesty giving lies that are contrary to scripture, even lying words given by those who speak contrary to my Words, even those who prophesy falsely in my name.</p>
<p>Yet, many amongst my church my body and even my bride continue to allow these false shepherds to overthrow their expectations that their Bridegroom is approaching on a day they themselves decide, even a false prophesy contrary to what has already been announced by YHVH, the Great I AM, and also even by Christ Jesus at Adonai-YHVH command because I always do the will of he who sent me. Because I am the Word made flesh who truly dwells amongst you and even in you by that holy spirit of sonship, that truly fills the lights of the World fully who are clothed in power from high! Still many of you willingly choose to sit in darkness even ignoring the very Words that would extinguish the fiery darts of the wicked, which many of you foolishly prefer. Truly, truly, I am he who sits with billow in hand even stoking the flames of purification, that truly truly, you all may be readied for the appearing of your Lord, because I am coming for you my Loves, and who is there who can stop me? I asked, and so I ask again, I SAY WHO!</p>
<p>Yet, so it is. That my Bride now sits somber in bewilderment, even stuck on the words of those who peep and mutter! And so I command you to reject these false words, even all those who would place their faith and trust in false wizards who peep and mutter and who speak contrary to my Words of life, for I have plainly stated in scripture, and scripture cannot be broken: That no man on earth knows the day, time, nor hour of the great gathering of the faithful to Christ set to occur so suddenly and unexpectedly now. And I have commanded you all to keep your hearts expectation and minds fully focused on your Everlasting Lord of Righteousness who surely does approach for you my Loves, even all of my wise virgins who have trimmed your wicks, and filled their lamps with the pure oil of my spirit, so that truly truly you may be readied for the appearing of your Bridegroom and that you may be fully prepared and waiting at the ready complete with our guests. Even all who are called, chosen, and invited to that great marriage of the Bridegroom to his bride, even that very day that is barreling down on you all so suddenly and unexpectedly now.</p>
<p>So why does my Bride sit somber in sadness as if your Bridegroom has jilted you and left you standing by the wayside rejected, jilted and brokenhearted in your expectations? No, my faithful these things are not for you, but will be given in judgment to the unfaithful, and all those who refuse the invitation of their Everlasting Lord of Righteousness to ready themselves according to my commandments, in all loving obedience to the voice and instructions of their Lord!</p>
<p>Therefore, I do come to remind you yet once again of these Words given in times of old to the Children of Promise, even Israel after the flesh in the times of their revealing, and even Words that stand to this day my loves, therefore, hear the Words of your Lord and receive my instruction in all meekness, humbleness, lowliness of heart, and readiness of mind. Hear and Obey: And if you think in your heart, How will we know the word which the Lord has not spoken? When a Prophet speaks in the Name of the Lord, if the thing follows not nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken, but the Prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: you shall not therefore be afraid of him.</p>
<p>Yet, so many amongst you have forgotten these Words that are given as boundaries and safe guards against ravenous wolves, whose judgment surely lingers not. Therefore, compare diligently the words of anyone who claims to speak for Christ Jesus, who is also Yeshua HaMashiach diligently to my established Words given and protected in the holy writings, even holy Words given in the times of old by Adonai-YHVH, the Great I AM, and even holy Words given in the times of now by Adonai-YHVH and Christ Jesus, who is also Yeshua HaMashiach.</p>
<p>Therefore, my Loves, hear the Words of your everlasting Lord of Righteousness, even Words given by my hands as I unveil them into the heart of my mighty messenger and servant and by my hands and will are these Words unveiled in understanding from the heart of my mighty messenger and servant where I, Christ Jesus do give these Words of comfort, even soothing Words to comfort the faithful in Christ, even my wise virgins who have prepared themselves by these Words that are given to be released into the earth for the faithful in Christ in all obedience even so that you all are readied and prepared and waiting by the wayside with your lamps filled, and your wicks trimmed, even all of you who have taken my fire and lit your lamps in righteous obedience to my Words, because I do approach for you my Loves.</p>
<p>And so it is, the Bridegroom does approach for his Bride and the earth so suddenly now will be overtaken in pitch blackness, because I will not share my glory with another, and as the blackness of darkness blankets the earth, the glory and brightness of my appearing will lighten the earth even as lightning comes out of the east and goes into the west, and so suddenly and unexpectedly now will my Church, my Body, and Even my Bride find themselves standing in the heaven of heavens, even standing in the throne room of YHVH, the Great I AM, even a moment of time that Adonal-YHVH has waited from eternities past, even a time so long ago that you cannot comprehend at this time. And you have all been hidden in his might and wonderful heart of love and light, even where he kept you protected in his greatest mystery ever even the Great Mystery Of Yahweh, the Great I AM, and truly truly the heavens are readied and already rejoice at your so sudden arrival now, even before you have arrived. For even the holy angels and magnificent creatures of the heavens excitedly await your appearing and presence my Loves.</p>
<p>Therefore, rest your minds and hearts fully in my love for you my children, and do not allow false words given by false prophets who peep and mutter and who set dates for my Galilean wedding to overthrow your faith, neither make you sad in heart as if I will jilt my lovely Bride who has readied herself in loving obedience to the voice of her Bridegroom. And so I command you my loves to focus you entire heart, soul, mind, and strength on the Words of your Everlasting Lord of Righteousness, even my holy Words of scripture that I have revealed in that open little book that I have opened in my messenger and servants hands, because the little book of revelation chapter 10 contains the utterances of the seven thunders as well as the everlasting gospel in part, and these are Words that are given to lead my people through the harvests of Jacob's trouble even Daniel's seventieth week. Even Words that have been sealed and kept secret by command of YHVH, the Great I AM, because truly, truly, the utterances and voice of the seven thunders does speak, and these seven thunders are the activation of the book of revelation, even Daniel's seventieth week that will result in the full and utter destruction of Heylel Ben Shachar's kingdom forevermore, and the earth will be ruled in Righteousness, even a righteousness where no evil thing will enter my millennial kingdom, so rest in great hope in these Words of hope and eternal promise my Loves.</p>
<p>I am Christ Jesus, and I do come to bring these Words of chastisement, reproof, and love to the obedient, and disobedient that truly, truly, you do not fall to the disobedient side of my sword of the spirit, even so that you will be counted worthy to be gathered with the faithful so suddenly and unexpectedly now. Because even in these last minutes before that mighty shout echoes, and before that mighty trumpet blast sounds so mightily and unexpectedly now, I do still shake and cause great shaking to come over my people, even so that I may shake the unfaithful so they may become faithful in righteous obedience, or fall away to the refiners fire in their disobedience, even right before that moment of kairos intersects with chronological time that is about to overtake you all so suddenly and unexpectedly now. Even as the world mourns their false saviour, even a false martyr I did not send, but who was supplied by Barabbas instead, and yet so many now follow this false martyr, even led astray from the voice of Christ Jesus who is also Yeshua HaMashiach, Selah.</p>
<p>And so it is, that I do prepare those who will be left fully to the refiners fire, even all those who will be given the chance to call on the name of Jesus Christ until their end, for all who love their lives not to the end in such manner will find eternal salvation that truly truly, does not compare to the suffering they will endure for my names sake.</p>
<p>Prepare yourselves my Church my Body and Even my Bride, prepare and ready yourselves according to my holy Words and writings of the Everlasting Gospel and wait for me my loves for I am coming for you and you will not be disappointed in your expectations. Therefore, receive my reproof and chastisement and be obedient to my Words and warnings for I am coming for you my Loves, and I will never leave the faithful in Christ to the refiners fire, nor to the judgment of sinners that is not for you.</p>
<p>Ready yourselves my Loves, in all obedience and expectation, and immerse yourselves in the Words of the Everlasting Gospel, and hold them in your minds and hearts and understand the treasure of scripture that I have given into the earth to keep you in these times of revealing, even a revealing I started with the many prepared trumpets in my little flock that have sounded faithfully, even which trumpets prepared the way for my messenger and servant who is a chosen vessel unto his Everlasting Lord, even Christ Jesus, who is also Yeshua HaMashiach, even where I do reveal my Words into my set apart vessel who is in agreement and fully committed to the purposes I have commissioned him for, and it is by my command and power that his fingers find the keys even to reveal these holy Words that I have given into him to release into the earth for the first time, even Words that are tuned to find the eyes, ears, and hearts of all those to whom they are sent, Selah.</p>
<p>Therefore, hear the sound of my voice in this holy announcement that is given to draw the faithful to my command, and to tune you all in obedience to the sound of that trumpet, that you may be gathered to me at my command.</p>
<p>Behold! I do sign this announcement and letter by the hand of my messenger and servant, yet signed in my very own name in all love and authority,</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Yeshua HaMashiach, The Everlasting Lord of Righteousness.</i></p>
