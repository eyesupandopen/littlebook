<h1 id="ph">Behold! A Synopsis of Declarative Judgments on Secret Babylon Before Judgment Falls in Full</h1>
<div id="prophecy" class="skiptonropadding padsmaller">
<p>The following judgments are from The Little Book of Revelation Chapter 10, which is also The Everlasting Gospel. Judgment on Secret Babylon has been declared now for many jubilees and years. Following are declarative Judgments taken from the Little Book that will surely come to pass so suddenly and unexpectedly now. In this capacity, I function as a judicial messenger sent to declare judgments from the throne of Yahweh, given in the face of Jesus Christ, whom I do serve.</p>
<p>Let it be known, that today even June 16th, 2025 on the Gregorian Calendar (even the same calendar used by Secret Babylon) that my Ascended Lord Christ Jesus, even Yeshua HaMashiach commands me to read these judgments on Secret Babylon, even these United States of America, so that anyone may repent while there is still a moment of fleeting time, and so that judgment is declared before fire falls. Selah!</p>
<p><b>This declaration is not exhaustive as these are not new judgments but have been released in full from March 2, 2024, to March 20, 2025.</b> Most of these are from Yeshua HaMashiach, with one section from Yahweh, the Great I AM. I will now move to declare.</p>
<div class="quotedlink jn-header"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro1">1</span><a href="/prophecy/behold-judgment-comes-and-the-times-are-now">Behold! Judgment Comes and the Times Are Now!</a><span>June 4, 2024 (Voice: Yeshua HaMashiach)</span></div>
<p>As the gathering together happens, the restrainer is removed, and great destruction will overtake the earth, suddenly and in an instant. For as the restrainer is removed, nothing will remain to hinder the evil in the world and the lusts and evil passions of mankind. Great war will break across the earth, and brother will once again rise to kill their brother, and great shall their destruction be. Many nations will fall as Mystery Babylon, even that great whore who sits on many waters, will be made desolate in one hour. That great city, even that nation of many United States, will be utterly destroyed; for she has earned a double portion of judgment, and she is worthy.</p>
<p>For she lived deliciously in great sin; she sits in great arrogance thinking she can never fall and things will continue, yesterday as today, and tomorrow ever more the same and unchanging. And the great whore has corrupted the earth with the golden cup in her hand, full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication. And so her judgment will fall suddenly. Great fire will overtake her cities as missiles fall; great shaking will occur, and that nation will split along the middle. Her coasts will be greatly flooded, and never will she rise again, for great are her sins and great is her judgment.</p>
<div class="quotedlink jn-header"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro2">2</span><a href="/prophecy/hear-my-words-and-understand-the-times-in-which-you-live">Hear My Words and Understand the Times in Which You Live!</a><span>May 23, 2024 (Voice: Yeshua HaMashiach)</span></div>
<p>Hear my Words, my people, even all whom I am calling, and understand the times in which you live. For the world you now know will cease to exist, and in its place many wastelands will remain, even the ashes and ruins of Mystery Babylon, for war has come. For as I snatch my Bride into the heavens, great calamity will engulf Mystery Babylon, and she shall be destroyed in one hour, and in one hour shall she be destroyed, and nothing can change her fate, for Yahweh has so declared. For you, Secret Babylon, you have rejected my voice and set me, Jesus Christ the Righteous, aside for the pleasures of sin. For even the great warnings given over your nation in the heavens served only to provide entertainment for your faithless hearts and lustful eyes, and to you it was just another day as you lived deliciously in your sins that are leading you to your destruction. You should have repented! For you have become a nation of idolaters, a nation of warmongers, a nation who feasts on lies and who loves their delusions, a nation who has filled the earth with your abominations; and the nations drink of your golden cup which is full of abominations and filthiness of your fornication.</p>
<p>And so that finality will fully arrive when I gather the faithful of my Church to me in the clouds and when their departing shakes the entire world. It will literally shake the earth, and great shaking will consume Secret Babylon, and she will be rent up the middle as my saints depart. She will be utterly burned with fire from the sky as the missiles will fall. Her skirts will be covered with waters from the east and from the west! For a mighty angel will take up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all. For thus is it written and thus shall it be done! For great is her judgment, and judgment has begun at the house of God. Her apostate churches will be destroyed, for I have judged them all that are not of me, even all the fake churches who speak great lies in hypocrisy. Mystery Babylon, oh, that you had turned to me, Jesus Christ, from your evil ways, for I would have saved you, and neither me nor Yahweh have any pleasure in the judgments that are about to be unleashed.</p>
<p>Oh, Secret Babylon, your bridges will fall; your roads will be overturned, broken, and unpassable; your supply chains are already crumbling and will soon be desolate. No provisions will be delivered to you, for nobody will come to your aid, and you will be alone in your hour of desolation, oh, great harlot. You will have no happiness, and those who survive will find themselves fighting just to have a drink of water. Starvation will overtake the land. And great pestilence will overtake you, and even the animals will attack, for the times are here.</p>
<p>The red armies that your treasonous government allowed into your borders will slay every man, woman, and child who does not fit their purposes. For they will kill and enslave all they find. They are the armies of the beast that have been gathered from the four corners of the earth for this purpose, and the concealed beast and concealed false prophet have gathered them.</p>
<p>They have no sympathy, no mercy, no grace, no remorse, and they utterly hate the inhabitants of Mystery Babylon for the awful sins your leaders have perpetrated on their lands. And all the while so many of you cheered on your unjust wars as you watched in amusement on your televisions, as you took great pleasure in the sins of your leaders. You have given your consent to your leaders whose sins you endorsed by vote, and so you will share in their judgment, for you have made yourselves worthy of a double portion of judgment, and it will overtake you suddenly. And so my Bride will appear at my judgment seat, and some will suffer loss, some will carry away great reward, and all will receive fully of the down payment they have already received: For I will give them new, sinless bodies that will never corrupt!</p>

<p>They will step on the world stage in great power, and an alliance of ten kings will rule. Even now, the alliance has already arrayed their hosts in secret for a secret attack on Secret Babylon. They have secretly set themselves to the ready, and they have surely coordinated an attack, and they have openly invaded Secret Babylon according to the judgment declared by God that is about to befall her, of which she shall never again rise. For her iniquities have come before the most High, and her sins before the great throne of heaven, even before the great eternal God, for there is none greater; and judgment has been pronounced on her.</p>
<p>I bring great wrath on Secret Babylon. Time is a luxury you no longer possess. You cannot be lazy any longer, or you will find yourselves in Jacob's trouble, when I would have set a place for you at my table and wed you as my bride, but you are unfaithfully in the arms of another, even Satan! So come to me so that I may restore you to your reward. It is not enough to hit the exits in disgust; you must repent of this wickedness and change your ways and confess these sins to me, and I will cleanse you in my atoning blood and wipe the stains from you in my perfect purity, for I am clean and my garments as white as the fresh snow. Return to me and forever will you be with me; come out and come to my outstretched arms, for I am here to tell you that you do not have any time to waste.</p>

<p>Let me open your eyes, you who are willingly ignorant and blind, you who sit in filth and darkness, rolling in the mire. You cannot give your consent to evil and think you are serving me, for I resisted evil and temptation until the very last drop of blood flowed from me onto the red earth, for I am the last Adam and I have been made a quickening spirit. So many of you are blinded by good words and fair speeches and give your full consent to criminals and horrible people who prey on children. They molest children, they torture children for their own evil lusts: For so comes the wrath of God on Mystery Babylon, but so many of you persist in giving your consent to these brute beasts who are set aside for the eternal hellfires that will never be quenched. Come out of her, my people, or you will share in her plagues and the awful judgment that is coming on her; and I have warned you. For what concord has Christ with Belial? If you share in her lies, you will share in her plagues; so completely separate yourselves in word and in deed, and do not agree with them in the least. Do not live careless, compromised lives; for I will punish all who do. You think because you have eternal life that you can't experience great loss and consequence? I will strip your rewards and give them away, and you will be the least in the kingdom of heaven if you persist, for so says Yeshua HaMashiach, the Bridegroom, to my Bride!</p>

<p>I am coming, and I will not hold my peace, and my anger is hot against Secret Babylon, yea, Secret Babylon who traffics the little ones for merchandise into the hands of evil men, who will be stopped. It would be better that they had never been born than to be born and commit lawless and grievous sins against the children. It would be better that a millstone were hung around their necks, and they were cast into the seas; but they are reserved for everlasting fire, and justice will soon be done, as the wrath of the Lamb is about to cover the entire earth and Jacob's trouble breaks loose when the restrainer is removed. But you, oh, Secret Babylon the great, have desecrated my Father's bow of many colors that he gave to Noah and all mankind as a promise that he would never destroy the entire earth by water again, and he will keep his word. But you, oh, Mystery Babylon, will be laid waste in one hour.</p>
<p>Great fire will come upon you; great shaking will flatten you; your towers will fall; your infrastructure will disappear in ruins, and great waves will overtake your coasts, and I will reward you according to your works, and great judgment is against you. For you were once a beacon of hope and a light to the world for a short season, but you have chosen greed, selfishness, and corruption as your bedfellows, oh, great harlot! Who will save you from me and my anger and my approaching wrath that is hot on you? You stand in chains, awaiting your final judgment, which will be evident for the world to see, and great fear will come on many.</p>
<p>Behold! Many nations my Father has overthrown in judgment, for he sets up one and brings down another, for Yahweh is sovereign and there is none greater than the great eternal God who stands for and saves his own from the fires reserved for the evil ones. Behold! The nations that made up great empires still remain, yet in a diminished way, but continued they have. But you, oh, great harlot, you have prostituted yourself with many lovers for base greediness and the pleasures of sin. You have led my people away from me worldwide by the filth you have offered the nations to eat and drink, and you will be utterly cast down, and never again will you be. And of your ashes a great nation will not arise, yet a remnant will be saved. The hand of the enemy is on your necks, and I have brought the dregs into your borders. They will pillage, plunder, and seize what remains.</p>
<p>Who will help you? For you have denied your neighbor, and there is no fear of the Lord in your hearts. You have said, I am no widow, yet you are widowed and blind and deaf before me. There is no salvation for you on account of your adulterous fornication that you have committed with the world; therefore, I will bring you to utter ruin. Coming events will happen faster and faster; then a great deluge will cover your skirts. Fire will burn you utterly and will cleanse the evildoers from the land, and my captives will be freed, and nothing can stop what is about to happen. I am the Lord Jesus Christ, and I tell you before it happens, and I declare what is about to happen as if it has occurred already, for certain are these sayings, and nothing can alter them, as prophecies shall be fulfilled. Stand firm, my people, as I will catch my bride away; for I have plans and purposes for her in my coming kingdom.</p>

<p>Those who will not separate themselves from her will share in her judgment, so why would you yet choose death over the life I have given you, paid for in my own sinless blood? War is about to come fully on your land and nation, and even though it is already underway — yes, an undeclared war they fight against you — soon it will break across the entire world as the seals are loosed. Great war and great persecution will come over the earth as they will try to destroy anything of God and his Christ as they will eventually openly declare holy war on you. They will capture many, and many will be taken, and those who will be saved will have but one choice: endure to the end and love not their lives until the end and call on my name till the end.</p>
<p>Your own leaders have betrayed you and will sacrifice many to the wicked one in the battles that will soon rage. Your nation will be attacked from within and from without. The red armies are already here, and they await their orders; for they plan a surprise attack, and many will be taken. The armies of the evil one will take everything from the land for their own and from those who reject me. They will steal your land, your homes, your posterity; and many lives will be lost in unbelief. War is coming from without as many nations are aligned against you; and they have your leaders' consent, and your leaders work for your deaths. They want a world of their own, a world dedicated to Satan where they can fully follow the evils that dwell in them, and nothing will restrain their evil desires, as the restrainer will be gone.</p>
<p>They will utterly burn Secret Babylon with fire, and whoever does not succumb to the flames will succumb to famine; whoever does not succumb to famine will succumb to pestilence; whoever does not succumb to the edge of the sword will be delivered to the gallows for my name, and many will be beheaded as my Holy Word declares. And those who are martyred for my name will have great reward, and I will wipe all tears from their eyes. Know, my children, that all delicacies and pleasures of sin that evil men treasure to themselves will but vanish into thin air, and tribulation and anguish will stand in their places. Darkness will cover the land, and there will be a dearth of my Word, and the voice of the bride and the voice of the bridegroom will not be heard in her anymore.</p>

<p>Hear the voice of wisdom and bow the knee and hear the living voice of Yeshua HaMashiach, for I am the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, and I am King of Kings and Lord of Lords! El Shaddai, even the Almighty God, has highly exalted me and given me a name above every name. That at the Name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth: And that every tongue should confess, that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of the Father of Lights, even Yahweh, the everlasting and eternal God, for there is none like our Father!</p>
<p>Hear the voice of your Lord and understand things that are already underway and things that are soon to happen, for behold I am he who speaks of things to come as if they have already occurred for surely your great Lord, even me Christ Jesus the preeminent one will do nothing, except I reveal my secrets to my servants the Prophets. Why do you hearken to so many contradictory voices, and why halt you between two opinions? Have I not stated that my prophets speak in unison and will never contradict my holy Words? For I am the Word made flesh who dwells among you by my holy spirit that is born within you forevermore, for each and every soul who is born again is sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is my incorruptible seed and the seal of the Living God cannot be broken. And the day of redemption of the purchased possession is at hand and your full redemption is here.</p>
<p>Thus says the Lord of Hosts, hear not the words of the prophets who prophesies to you, and teaches you vanities: they speak the vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord. Come to me my children because the anointing which you have received of me, abides in you: and you need not that any man teach you: But, as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is true, and is no lie: and even as it has taught you, you shall abide in me. My children abide in me and compare the words of anyone who claims to speak for me with scripture and ask me to confirm in your spirit, if perhaps you will listen to my voice for many of you are hard of hearing, and many of you love false words that tickle your ears so you may appear wise but instead follow the false words of presumptuous fools.</p>
<p>Behold! I speak of the times of Jacobs trouble that is ready to break across the entire earth. For judgment is already underway and cannot be stopped, for what Yahweh declares can no one change! Many, many tears have I cried over Mystery Babylon's judgment and I have sent my prophets for many, many years now and have even sent strangers from strange lands to witness and prophecy of the judgments that were approaching but are now here.</p>
<p>For so it will be for so it is written: The ten horns which you saw upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate, and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. For God has put in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled. And the woman, which thou saw, is that great city which reigns over the kings of the earth.</p>
<p>Hear my words, Secret Babylon's judgment is already underway. The ten horns have prepared their surprise attack and their attack approaches and is at your door. For even your media seeks to soothe you to sleep and many sit in darkness blind to reality saying: I sit as a Queen and am no widow and will see no mourning. Tomorrow will be as today, for today is as yesterday. In as much as she glorifies herself, and lives in pleasure, so much give to her torment and sorrow: Therefore shall her plagues come at one day, death, and sorrow, and famine, and she shall be burnt with fire: for Yahweh who condemns her, is the Almighty God and there is none greater and there is nothing that can stop El Shaddai's mighty hand!</p>
<p>And so the sun will soon rise on a day of calamity you do not expect, and that day is nearer than you imagine. And that day will bring utter destruction on Mystery Babylon, for she has a double portion of judgment declared against her. Her crimes and fornication are many and her penalty lingers not and great punishment will fall on the unrepentant even as my faithful Church and even my faithful Bride will be gathered to me suddenly in the clouds and saved from wrath, even the great trouble of Daniel's seventieth week. Babylon the Great is Fallen, is Fallen! Hear my words for I speak as if it is already happened for nothing will change, slow, hinder, nor stop Yahweh's judgments from crashing onto the earth.</p>
<p>In one hour she will be burned with fire, some of her cities will burn, some of her cities will be violently flooded, her towers will fall and break in many pieces, her bridges will fall, and much shaking will occur. The earth will be torn asunder violently and much land will be covered over in violent waters. Her skirts will be covered from the east and from the west in great waves and up the middle rushing waves and violent shaking. Of what remains will be a wasteland and never again will she rise, for this nation of many states and many cities shall never rise again and great will be her fall! For the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof, and all aspects of her evil influence will forever be erased from the nations during Daniel's seventieth week, for so I will cleanse the earth in my wrath. I, Christ Jesus, the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, have declared these words, and preparation for their fulfillment is already underway and will suddenly be fulfilled in one hour.</p>
<p>And so war will break across the earth as part of the surprise attack on Secret Babylon, for this is planned and coordinated for many jubilees now, for the mystery of iniquity has been at work since the days of old and will reach full consummation once the restrainer is removed as my faithful are taken into the heavens. War will fall across the earth and will come onto all peoples and all nations, for this is the third such war, as the fallen ones seek to destroy the old orders of the world and replace all things with their new order, even the order of the Dragon. The beast from the sea and the beast from the earth will rise in great fury, and they will make war with the saints, for it is given to them to overcome the saints. So it will be that all who love not their lives and call on the name of the Lord till the end shall be saved into everlasting joy into the eternity of eternities. And I Jesus the Nazarene have left an eternal example of obedience unto death, for my obedience to Yahweh was even the death of the cross as I suffered and paid for the sins of mankind as the lamb of God and behold I am coming as the Lion of the Tribe of Judah and I will not be stopped nor hindered!</p>
<div class="quotedlink bs-header"><span class="quotedlinknro" id="nro9">9</span><a href="/prophecy/babylon-the-great-is-fallen">Babylon the Great Is Fallen, Is Fallen!</a><span>August 18, 2024 (Voice: Yeshua HaMashiach)</span></div>
<p>And so there is a pause where the fallen ones are allowed to move their pieces into place on the worlds' chess board, and a pause where the last remaining souls are now boarding the Ark of eternal life in me Christ Jesus their risen Lord and Savior. Yet, so many of you in your faithless reasoning conclude my Words as false and foolishly conclude that you have time to return to your old lives of sin and pleasure.</p>
<p>Except, suddenly, will the faithful be taken in refuge to the throne room of Yahweh himself in great reward and eternal splendor and eternal inheritance, and the faithful will all be changed forevermore.</p>
<p>Will you remain amongst the faithful? Do you have the humility to recognize your own unfaithfulness and repent so you may join the ranks of the faithful? Should you choose to see, I Christ Jesus, will show you. So why do you grow weary in well doing? Have you decided that those whom I bring you to and those whom I bring to you are unworthy of eternal life?</p>
<p>And so I counsel you to show the same mercy and grace to your fellow man that I have showed to you in this final pause before destruction descends. And in so doing you will save many, for you are still my ambassadors. So open your mouths in faith, doubting nothing, and I will inspire within you the words to speak. And so my little ones and even my faithful grow restless and impatient, even in this final pause before my Church and Bride are taken into the heavens. Yet, as it was in the wilderness when Moses met Yahweh on Sinai that the children rose up to eat and to drink and to play, and they made to themselves a golden calf to worship in place of the living God, of whose presence they were not allowed but stood near and saw the glory of the presence of the great eternal God on Sinai!</p>
<p>And in like manner as Moses interceded for the children, so I also intercede for all who are heirs of eternal salvation, that all who are called may come fully to salvation and repentance from their evil and faithless ways. Return to my voice and remain in the havens I have given you, and I will protect you from judgment that is not for you. Have I not told you to come out from amongst them and be separate? Obey my voice!</p>
<p>And so judgment now falls on the earth and judgment has been prepared of old for the unbelieving and stiff-necked, even those who willingly or ignorantly cling to Satan's rebellion. For many, many, many people will willingly choose the flames that are intended for the devil and his angels instead of departing from sin and coming to eternal life by calling on Jesus the Nazarene for their salvation. And so it will be, for El Shaddai, even the Almighty God, has given freewill to mankind that mankind may choose either to live righteously and in peace before Yahweh, or choose eternal destruction in that great lake of fiery blue made for the fallen ones where their worm dies not. And the times of judgment are now. So I tell all who will hear of events that will happen before they happen.</p>
<p>These events are not secret but have been heralded by my prophets and servants for many years now, even all those whom I have sent to Secret Babylon. For the times of Judgment of that great whore are here, and the beast who carries her will now destroy her utterly. For God has put it into the hearts of the ten horns to fulfill his will, and they hate the whore, and will continue to make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and continue to burn her with fire. And so will secret Babylon be made utterly desolate and laid bare in shame for all to see.</p>
<p>Her once great cities that were examples of hard work and production and the abundance of El Shaddai now sit in ruins with her posterity addicted to drugs and living in filth on her disgusting streets. And she is made naked as her defenses are off shored even further and her wealth and strength is given into the hands of her Edomite enemies who pretend they are allies. The great whore who made war with all nations she was sent to conquer is now bound, and defenseless and ready to be fully conquered. And all flesh will be consumed in misery and all who are captured will be culled and those who are able to serve the beast's purposes will be carried away into slavery and the rest will be killed, though a remnant will survive.</p>
<p>And she is ablaze and there are many fires already in her borders and in the lands of her neighbors to the north who share in her plagues. And yet these are just the birth pangs and are not the final judgments but a warning to all of their impending destruction. For suddenly will it happen, and suddenly will it occur. It will occur only and even as I snatch my faithful from the earth to safety and I will suddenly gather Yahweh's wheat into his everlasting barn, for the times of harvest are here. Yet not the final harvest, but the first of several, and so judgment begins at the house of God. Secret Babylon, your times have come, and your days are at an end.</p>
<p>I, Jesus the Nazarene, have shed countless tears over your impending destruction and I have sent signs above, and wonders in the skies, and signs in the earth and even many sudden cataclysms occur in real time and in her midst and still Secret Babylon stops her ears in stubborn rebellion, and now she will fully eat of her rebellious ways.</p>
<p>So understand, that as I suddenly gather the faithful to safety and reward, so too will sudden destruction fall on mystery Babylon as the restrainer is fully removed. Hear my words and understand my voice because the restrainer is the only thing keeping the destructive lusts of the fallen ones restrained until he who restrains no longer restrains and is taken from the midst. Then shall sudden destruction come upon the entire world. The battle lines are drawn, and they have prepared for their third world war, even their war to fully overturn the ways of old and the orders of old. And so fire will fall suddenly on Secret Babylon and her cities will be destroyed.</p>
<p>Fire will fall suddenly as the missiles crash across her lands, leaving her burnt and naked. Yet many of her cities along her sinful coasts will fall to the waters that will come suddenly and will crash on her shores flooding inland for many, many miles and this will happen from the east and from the west. The earth will suddenly quake uncontrollably, and great destruction will come on the lands of secret Babylon, and the lands will be disfigured and altered. Her bridges will fall, and her roads will become impassable, and a wilderness and a wasteland will remain.</p>
<p>The stench of death will cover her lands and pestilence and disease will fill her lands and utterly helpless will she be. And as this final attack takes place, the hordes of the Red Army will be fully unleashed on the remaining inhabitants of the land. They will kill all who resist and will kill many who do not resist. For the people of secret Babylon are sold into slavery by the mountainous debts she has incurred, for by usury the fallen ones work to destroy the masses. And in so much as her people have pledged and signed their lives away for material gain and the pleasures of sin, so too will those whom they choose to enslave serve those they are indebted in forced labor and the mark will be enforced for all who survive, only take not the mark.</p>
<p>And so the world that now is, will be suddenly replaced with the ashes of ruins and smoldering remains of a once vibrant society. And so famine will descend on the lands, for Secret Babylon has caused famine on many lands and now famine will be her dinner guest, for so she has given and so doubly she will now receive. Water will be a sought after commodity, and many waters will be made bitter from the destruction and fires of war and from the plagues of the unburied that will pollute the land. And many will needlessly suffer and perish in judgment for their sins, when such a thing was not necessary for them but those who remain amongst the judged will themselves be judged, yet any and all who call on the name of their Lord until the end shall be saved, but they will have to endure until their last breath. For faithfulness to the end has always been a requirement for the faithful, even Yahweh's very own children of Abraham who are the children of promise, for the just shall live by faith. And so will secret Babylon be utterly split along the middle and the waters will rush where there was once fertile dry land, even the heart lands will be flooded up the center.</p>
<p>And so God's mercy and grace will be utterly removed from the earth when the restrainer is suddenly removed and destruction will marry destruction, for these are the times of destruction where Satan's kingdom will be fully judged and fully destroyed, but first they will serve Yahweh's purposes in utterly consuming mystery Babylon and so will she be utterly burnt and consumed in many raging fires that will engulf and begin to cleanse the land. And so Secret Babylon's destruction will come to pass in one hour, for as it is written so shall it be done, and she will receive a double portion of judgment.</p>
<p>And as it is written, so shall it be done. For it is written of old by John the Revelator: I saw another Angel come down from heaven, having great power, so that the earth was lightened with his glory, And he cried out mightily with a loud voice, saying, It is fallen, it is fallen, Babylon that great city, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of all foul spirits, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the Kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are grown rich of the abundance of her pleasures.</p>
<p>And I heard another voice from heaven say, come out of her, my people, that you be not partakers of her sins, and that you receive not of her plagues. For her sins are come up into heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities. Reward her, even as she has rewarded you, and give her double according to her works: and in the cup that she has filled for you, fill hers double. In as much as she glorified herself, and lived in pleasure, so much give you to her torment and sorrow: for she says in her heart, I sit being a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no mourning. Therefore, shall her plagues come at one day, death, and sorrow, and famine, and she shall be burnt with fire: for God which condemns her, is a strong Lord!</p>
<p>And so this once great nation of states and many cites will fall suddenly, and the angel of destruction currently hovers over her greatest and largest city on the eastern waters and her pride and joy and envy of the world will be utterly destroyed never to rise again. And so too will her destruction be shared by all those who have joined her, for she is that great whore who sits on many waters that are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues. For their judgment lingers not, and all the kings of the earth have joined the ten horns in their surprise attack. For their leaders willingly serve the fallen ones, for so are all worldly rulers.</p>
<p>There are none good, no, not one. These leaders have worked for many years to bring this attack to pass and have betrayed their own nations of which they were sent to deceive. And the people who willingly followed them in pleasure will fall to the fires of war, pestilence, death and destruction. And these things are at the ready to be suddenly released fully on the earth. And so all so-called Christian nations will fall by the sword as judgment begins at the house of God. And as it was in the days of old when Israel left the Father of Lights and served other gods, who by nature are no gods, so too will these be given into the hands of their enemies, even as the twelve tribes were divided and conquered of old for their betrayal of covenants and brought about by the curse of the law for the disobedient and hard-hearted.</p>

<p>(Trigger Event DJT)</p>
<p>So, this false Moshiach does travel and preach while speaking as a dragon and does pretend and say many great and blasphemous things even before he rises fully, and he will claim to rise. Understand my people that this false prophet who is also the beast from the earth who serves the Synagogue of Satan has now been selected as their lamb. And it will yet be that his head will appear as it were wounded to death, but his deadly wound was healed, and all the world will wonder and follow the beast. And so this deceiver will rise.</p>
<p>At his rising (happens after Secret Babylon falls) he will claim he has sacrificed himself like a lamb of God bringing peace to Israel as their dove which brings them an olive leaf! And not only Israel, but the earth itself and will appear that he has now come back to bring peace, but the ways of peace he does not know and at the judgment of Secret Babylon all out war will ensue. Because a false spirit of comfort from the dragon has settled on the earth, and I have even sent strong delusion so that all those who have pleasure in unrighteousness will believe a lie that all might be damned who have pleasure in unrighteousness. For when they shall say peace and safety, then sudden destruction and they shall not escape.</p>
<p>And many in Secret Babylon, even those who believe his lies and follow his good words and fair speeches are captivated and ensnared by a false peace where they imagine that their delicious and sinful lives will continue where today is as yesterday and tomorrow will be the same as today and many will scream, howl, and lament that their hope is now taken from them, and they will fight their countrymen to the death and all the while their full surprise attack will be fully unleashed, even as my restrainer is lifted from the earth and Secret Babylon will fall to a double portion of judgment in one hour as many calamities fall.</p>
