<h2 id="all7-1"><span class="quotedlinknro readnro" id="nro1">1</span>From Yeshua HaMashiach: Thunder One!</h2>
<p>My called, chosen, and faithful, hear the Words of your living Lord and savior, even Yeshua the Messiah! The nations in which you live and the histories you have been taught by your Jesuit educators are the backdrop of the great deception, whose full revealing is imminent and already in motion, whereby the fallen ones will appear as benevolent aliens but in truth are malevolent fallen angels. What is it that has been? It is that that shall be: and what is it that has been done? That which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.</p>
<p>Satan has offered his so-called advanced knowledge from the beginning, even his knowledge of good and evil. He is a master manipulator and liar who has taught many things to mankind that Yahweh did not intend, for these are the ways of death. Yahweh's creation is not made to be manipulated for personal power and gain or as a means to escape God's judgment, nor to establish one's own ways and order. For Satan has corrupted mankind from the beginning, and he has corrupted the fallen watchers who joined their rebellion.</p>
<p>Oh, you great enemy of all righteousness, even you Satans: your initial sins were recorded by Enoch the scribe all this time ago, and they stand to this very day, for your sins were so recorded. And so I will summarize, for you have done these things, and much more have you done: You led astray all the sons of God, and brought them down to the earth, and led them astray through the daughters of men. You imparted to the holy sons of God evil counsel, and led them astray so that they defiled their bodies with the daughters of men. You showed the children of men all the blows of death, and led astray Eve, and showed the weapons of death to the sons of men: the shield and the coat of mail, and the sword for battle, and all the weapons of death to the children of men. And from your hand they have proceeded against those who dwell on the earth from that day and forevermore.</p>
<p>You Satans taught the children of men the bitter and the sweet, and you taught them all the secrets of their wisdom. You instructed mankind in writing with ink and paper, and thereby many sinned from eternity to eternity and until this day. For men were not created for such a purpose, to give confirmation to their good faith with pen and ink. For men were created exactly like the angels, to the intent that they should continue pure and righteous; and death, which destroys everything, could not have taken hold of them, but through this knowledge they are perishing, and through this power it is consuming men.</p>
<p>You Satans showed the children of men all the wicked smitings of spirits and demons, and the smitings of the embryo in the womb, that it may pass away, and the smitings of the soul, the bites of the serpent, and the smitings which befall through the noontide heat, the son of the serpent named Tabââ'ĕt. For you even requested Michael to show you the hidden name, that you might enunciate it in the oath, so that those might quake before that name and oath who revealed all that was in secret to the children of men.</p>
<p>For you caused the watchers to join your rebellion as you further corrupted mankind. And so the sins of the watchers were so recorded by Enoch the scribe, and I will summarize as follows: They taught men to make swords, and knives, and shields, and breastplates, and made known to them the metals of the earth and the art of working them, and bracelets, and ornaments, and the use of antimony, and the beautifying of the eyelids, and all kinds of costly stones, and all coloring tinctures. They taught enchantments, and root-cuttings, the resolving of enchantments, astrology, the constellations, the knowledge of the clouds, the signs of the earth, the signs of the sun, and the course of the moon.</p>
<p>And so through your corruptions and lies, you have polluted Yahweh's creation with your evil ways and blasphemous abominations. You have led mankind astray and sinned against Yahweh, and you have wronged mankind, and even sinned against birds, and beasts, and reptiles, and fish, and your sins bring great judgment of which you will not recover. You have polluted Yahweh's creation with your technologies and manipulations, and you caused mankind to wonder after your tricks and falsehoods. For Yahweh only showed you the worthless mysteries of his creation and kept his most precious mysteries hidden in his heart away from your betrayal.</p>
<p>You evil ones taught your worthless ways to mankind as they multiplied on the face of the earth, and you brought great misery and destruction through your evil schemes and technologies. For you come not but to steal, kill, and destroy. You taught manipulation of the air, for you are the prince of the power of the air, for you manipulate the aithēr. For when Cain sinned, he built a city; and you have taught mankind your worthless secrets and manipulations. These cities were used for control and manipulation and to bring about mankind's destruction, as you used them to make your abominations of destruction.</p>
<p>You have caused nation to rise against nation in war and endless strife, and you caused my people to sin, and Yahweh has scattered the Tribes of Israel to the four winds. No matter, your evil intent has furthered the purposes of Yahweh, for by their scattering will the gathering of the remaining sheep be accomplished. And I will send my two witnesses to prophecy 1260 days clothed in sackcloth. In all your efforts to destroy Yahweh's children you have failed miserably, and you simply could not see that your efforts furthered Yahweh's purposes, for even his enemies obey his voice.</p>
<p>For you have persecuted and troubled the 12 tribes all across the earth as you sought their destruction. You have stolen children from mothers, and taken children from families and relocated them across the earth, and then lied to them and caused them to believe Jesuit fables regarding their true history, purposes, and origin. No matter, you have failed, because I, Yeshua HaMashiach, will fully reconnect them with their past, nation and true heritage, and I will make all who are heirs of salvation one new man, even in me, Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>By sleight of hand and great destruction, you have cleverly hidden away your technologies, even telling lies that the people of the past were ignorant and had no technology. For you showed the ancients your worthless mysteries, and there is nothing new under the sun. And so you hide the truth regarding your manipulations of the creation, even hiding them away from those you would seduce with your great deception. You have reintroduced your magic tricks yet once again, as you have set the stage so you can masquerade as aliens. And through your fake alien invasion you will cause all to wonder at your lying signs and wonders, even those whose names are not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world. But I, Yeshua HaMashiach, will expose you to the uttermost, and every hidden secret will come to light.</p>
<p>Behold! I will snatch away my faithful to the heavens, for I am coming for my Bride and I will not be stopped. And I, Yeshua HaMashiach, come to judge and make war and bring great judgment upon the earth, and you will not escape.</p>
<p>I, Yeshua HaMashiach, Lord of Lords and King of Kings, have sent these words by my servant, and by my servant have my words been sent, and all will be fulfilled.</p>
<h2 id="all7-2"><span class="quotedlinknro readnro" id="nro2">2</span>From Yahweh, the Great Eternal God: Thunder Two!</h2>
<p>Oh, you Satans, you have deceived my creation into following after your lying signs and wonders, and my wrath is hot on you. My people will be utterly separated from your tares that you have sown among my wheat in my garden of grace; and my Son, Christ Jesus, will gather my wheat in my barn, and so the Lord of harvest will gather, bind and burn your tares. Great judgment is upon you, and you will not escape my hand. From the beginning, you slithered and hid yourself among my children, even corrupting my little ones from the very beginning with your lies and deceit.</p>
<p>You are no gods, and those who followed your deception and delusions of victory are no gods either. You cannot create, for you lack the power, and I never created you with such abilities because I knew you would rebel before you were created; and in my justice and love I created you in righteousness, and you were perfect in the day you were created. In your worthless pride you boast of your own greatness, but you have no greatness, and I will fully expose you for the frauds you are. I will lay you in front of Kings, and they will see you and just how powerless you are. My son, Yeshua HaMashiach, utterly defeated you at Calvary, and you have no hope.</p>
<p>You are allowed to do only what I allow, as you are a defeated enemy. You stole the deed to the earth in your trickery and lies to Adam, and now my only begotten son, even Yeshua HaMashiach, has defeated you in his love for me and my creation; and the earth is his, even the Lord of Lords and King of Kings, for I have declared it. For he purchased the earth and mankind with his own sinless blood, and those who choose life will be redeemed. All your worthless works will be undone, and all who choose life will walk out of your lies and deception into newness of life, and I will make the faithful more glorious than you once were. For you have failed, oh weak and beggarly princes of the earth, even every prince in your order has failed along with you, oh slithering, lying serpent.</p>
<p>Now comes the time for your Judgment and your kingdom's utter destruction, even the kingdom you have built in your efforts to try and hide me, even Yahweh, from my creation. You will not escape. You will never again enter the heavens, for you are cast down to the earth never to return, and your place is in the heavens no more. You are bound to the earth that you lusted after, that was not yours to seize. Every one of your works will be undone in the lives of those you tried to destroy (and on the earth itself); they will forever dwell in peace and safety, and perfect happiness will they have, and I will dwell among mankind and I will be their God.</p>
<p>But you, oh slithering one, are powerless in my gaze, and you can do nothing to stop me. In the six days since the fall of man, for one day is a thousand years in my sight, you have accomplished nothing but your own judgment, damnation, destruction, and torment for you and all who follow. For you will be bound and cast into that great burning lake where I have made the hottest flames for you, even pure flames of blue, and you will forever burn, and I will recompense to you every evil work you have ever done, many times over. You have murdered multitudes upon multitudes, and you will pay for every soul that has been lost, and never will you escape. You will know all the sins you committed, and you will never escape from judgment, and you will forever be tormented for the sins you have committed. You will know full well your sins and offenses in your torment, and those you hate will have the final victory over you. And all the unrighteous ones whom you ever enticed to sin and commit themselves to join your rebellion, even those whose names were never written in the Book of Life, will share in your torment. You will all pay for every single sin you have committed, for you have sinned against Yahweh and against my creation, and I will repay. For in my justice I will recompense your own sins, actions, and evil ways fully back into your bosoms many times over and for all eternity. And I, Yahweh, even the great eternal God, swears these things by my own name, for I can swear by no greater.</p>
<p>You will serve my purposes, and in your hate and destruction you will drive my chosen to me; for I will lead them by the hand of Yeshua HaMashiach and his army of mighty men, for they will gather my remaining sheep. (Behold! The 144,000 sent by Yeshua HaMashiach will do mighty works in the face of your abominable evil.) And not one whom I have ordained to eternal life will fall to your schemes, for they can never be plucked from my hand, and neither can anyone pluck them from my Son's hands: For I have given him a name above every name, and he comes in the power of Yahweh himself, for I have shared my throne with him. And he will utterly crush your head. You have failed, little prince, and your time has come.</p>
<p class="indent">I, Yahweh, the great eternal God, have sent these words by my servant, and by my servant have my words been sent, and they shall come to pass. For Yahweh, the great eternal God, has so declared, and nothing can break my declarations. I AM El Shaddai!</p>

<div class="quotedlink jn-header"><a href="/prophecy/the-times-have-come">The Times Have Come</a><span>Thunders 3 & 4 (May 16, 2024)</span></div>
<h2 id="all7-3"><span class="quotedlinknro readnro" id="nro3">3</span>From Yeshua HaMashiach: Thunder Three</h2>
<p>Behold! The times of separation draw to a close, and my appearing has almost arrived now. It is very close and even the angels and host of heaven are at the trumpet's call. I have reached my outstretched arms to a dying world for many jubilees now, and many have accepted the peace treaty that my Father, Yahweh, sent to mankind, even me, Christ Jesus, for I am your peace. Yet many more have rejected my offer and my Father's grace and mercy that has been poured out on the earth.</p>
<p>Those who have been sealed and redeemed are those chosen from the foundation of the world. For my Father knew you from eternity to eternity, and you have always been at the center of his heart, as I have also been in the center of his heart, for I, Jesus the Nazarene, am Yahweh's only begotten son. And yet by my accomplished works as the perfect Passover and by the obedience of the only begotten, many, many sons of God have been born again into all eternity, even taken from the sons of men, for I am the Son of Man!</p>
<p>These times of grace were a mystery hidden in Yahweh's heart that he told nobody until he revealed it to me, and I have revealed it to my holy apostles and prophets and have preserved my holy Word for the ears and hearts of the chosen and faithful. For you, my Bride, are part of the great mystery of God, and your lives (which are hidden in me) are about to be revealed. And I will reward the faithful for all their faithful works that they have faithfully done in great faith to me, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>And so have I saved great multitudes by my atoning blood, for my blood was sinless and to this day I am sinless, for I will never sin. Those who have lived their lives faithfully in Christ will receive great reward, and they will shine as the stars in heaven, and great glory is theirs to be had, for they did not glorify themselves as if they were some great ones. But they have glorified me, Yeshua HaMashiach, and I will present them to my Father without stain or wrinkle, and their garments will be snow white and never will they be soiled. And they shall all live and never again sin, either through ungodliness or through pride. And they will be glorified in me.</p>
<p>For I am the chief shepherd, and I have led my flock to green pastures until the times of consummation, which are quickly coming upon the earth, for there is no more sand remaining to pass through the glass. And I will reward all, from the least to the greatest, in such a manner that you cannot comprehend at this time; but that comprehension is at your doorstep, for you will be taken into the heavens so very soon. And so shall my Bride be taken into glory, where I will judge her works and fully redeem every last man, woman, and child. I will reward them richly for even the smallest things that have been accomplished in service to me. For God is not unrighteous, to forget your work and labor of love, which ye have shown toward his Name, in that you have ministered to the Saints, and do minister.</p>
<p>Fear not, my Bride, for God does not judge as man judges, for man is unjust and a respecter of persons. Man glorifies those whom man deems important, and natural man most always ignores humility and virtue in favor of the haughty and self-accomplished. For natural man cries out to be accounted righteous before God, but natural man cannot overcome his sin nature and refuses to believe that he is corrupt, even denying the Lord of Lords, who would save him.</p>
<p>And so pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall. Instead of bowing their hearts to my words and wisdom and love that I have flooded on the earth, natural man instead chooses to follow his lusts and passions, for the courses of the world are designed by Satan to tempt and incite those passions, even the rewards of unrighteousness. And so the times of the Gentiles are coming to a close, and it is time for Jacob's trouble; for I will redeem Israel, even my faithful elect, who will come to me in repentance for their sins and the sins of their fathers who rejected me. And as it has been written, so let it be done.</p>
<p>Oh, natural man, why do you yet choose your sins and ignore my grace and salvation as if that is a light thing? Neither Yahweh nor I, Christ Jesus, have any pleasure in the coming judgments and the utter terror that will soon be unleashed. But God has not chosen this part of his plan so that he could be cruel to his creation: for God is love, and God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. The coming great trouble is designed to give mankind one last chance before it is too late for him. A great multitude will be saved out of the tribulation, even those who hold my name to their last breath and love not their lives to the end.</p>
<p>Natural man, you are so stubborn, and you will not listen, and you foolishly reject my grace, and I still pray the same: Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. For those who are left to great trouble, even those who have rejected my offer of peace, many will be lost to destruction, for they have rejected the Lord Jesus Christ. Yet, many will be saved, even all that call on the name of the Lord will be saved. And so yet the trials of fire are about to begin, for judgment approaches.</p>
<p>Great judgment is coming on Satan's kingdom! And you, natural man, even in your stubborn unbelief, refuse even the easiest request. For in my times of grace, salvation has been free and easy, and all one had to do was confess Jesus as Lord and believe God raised me from the dead. And so now there will be a famine of all things good in the land, even my Holy Word. A great, great time of trouble is approaching, and Satan foolishly prepares to make his stand, even arrogantly thinking he can win so that he and his angels can have a world of their own, a world without God, because their ways are perverse. Verily, that which has made itself crooked cannot be made straight, and there is no forgiveness nor peace to Satan and his angels, nor their offspring.</p>
<div class="indent">
<p>I am the son of God who has come in the flesh.</p>
<p>I am the Lion of the Tribe of Judah.</p>
<p>I am he who will rule the nations with a rod of iron.</p>
<p>I am he who will unleash the seals so very soon.</p>
<p>I am he who is coming for my Bride.</p>
<p>I am he who shall meet you in the air.</p>
<p>I am that I am, and the trumpet is about to sound.</p>
</div>
<p>I, Yeshua HaMashiach, have sent these Words.</p>
<h2 id="all7-4"><span class="quotedlinknro readnro" id="nro4">4</span>From Yahweh, the Great Eternal God: Thunder Four!</h2>
<p>Now comes the judgment of the eternal God, even Yahweh, for I am sending my Son, and there is no time remaining. Oh, you worthless ones who thought you could defeat Yahweh, even the great eternal God! Oh, you worthless ones who foolishly thought you could defeat my only begotten Son, Yeshua HaMashiach. You have heaped to yourselves eternal wrath, and my anger is fierce against you, for I am a jealous God. For from the beginning you have withstood my plans, and you have vexed, distressed, persecuted, tortured, and destroyed my creation. You have no peace.</p>
<p>Hear me and hear me well, for I declare what will become of you, and what Yahweh declares can no one alter, not once, not ever. And so your judgment comes. I will send my Son to gather my chosen and faithful, even the sons of Adam who have now become sons of God. You have failed, oh, you worthless serpent, who slithers in dishonesty and falsehood. For you are no gods, and you cannot ever deliver yourselves from my hand. For I will repay!</p>
<p>I will return to you every evil work and all the pain and suffering you have caused the innocent, and you will burn forever in the hottest flames of blue, and acrid poisonous smoke shall be your air, and in great torment will you forever be. For you caused me to destroy my creation, even the earth as it was before the flood of Noah, even on account of your worthless seed that you made for mankind's destruction; and so on account of these things, I will destroy you in your inheritance of fire.</p>
<p>And you tried to destroy the world after the flood of Noah, even making your abominations once again, but they will have no root nor branch; for all the tares will be plucked up, bound, and cast into the fire. And so will I destroy the earth in fiery judgment, for I promised never to flood the entire earth again. But in fire my judgment comes, for I am an all-consuming fire, and my anger boils over at the wicked. And so on account of these things, I will destroy you in the hottest fire and burning brimstone.</p>
<p>Hear me and hear me well, for I declare what will become of you, even you worthless watchers who left your first estate. You have no peace, and though I have unleashed you from your bonds for a short season, I have only done so in order that you may serve my purposes. Then great judgment is on you, and you have no peace. For you caused me to flood the earth on account of your abominations. Who are you to play creator with Yahweh's creation? Who are you to desecrate the garden of God with your unclean ways? You made your bastards and reprobates by defiling yourselves with women, and they will share in your inheritance of fire. For what did I tell Malachi: For behold, the day comes that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble, and the day that comes, shall burn them up, says the Lord of Hosts, and shall leave them neither root nor branch. Behold that day surely approaches, and all of you will pay according to your own evil ways.</p>
<p>For I have given men wives that they may be lacking nothing, wives for companionship and to bear them children. But you descended on Mount Hermon, even leaving your first estate of glory, and you have defiled yourselves with women, and you have no peace nor rest. As I had Enoch the scribe tell you in the age of your offense: You have no peace: a severe sentence has gone forth against thee to put thee in bonds: And thou shalt not have toleration nor request granted to you, because of the unrighteousness which thou hast taught, and because of all the works of godlessness and unrighteousness and sin which thou hast shown to men. And in bonds you shall go as you are cast into the lake of fire.</p>
<p>You harmed my creation for your own lusts, even forcefully taking many you chose as your wives, and you will pay. You have joined the Satans, even the princes who arrayed themselves against me, and you chose the lies of the seraphim. Therefore, you will join them in the great eternal lake of fire, and you will forever burn, and never will you have rest. You have hurt my creation and killed so many, and you have no regard for the lives I have created. Therefore, I will have no regard for you, and I have created you, and now comes your judgment and eventual destruction.</p>
<p>I say to the Satans, the watchers, the fallen cherubim, the fallen seraphim, even all who have joined the Satans' rebellion: you will utterly burn, over and over again for all eternity; for I will bind you and cast you into the fire where your worm dies not, even the flames reserved for you worthless ones that will burn the hottest flames just for you, for you are worthy. For I will do to you exactly what you have done to others. All the pain, sadness, regret, suffering, even every detestable act will be recompensed to you for all time, and you will not escape. I will lay you bare before the nations and expose you for the frauds you are, and they will say to the little gods (who are no gods): Art thou also become weak as we? Are thou become like unto us?</p>
<p>I will utterly recompense your evil ways back into your own bosoms, and you will forever pay. You will be cast alive into the flames, and you will burn in the presence of the Lamb, and the angels and all the righteous ones you have wronged will receive from me a multitude over what you took from them. For when you are recompensed of your evil, I will have recompensed my chosen and faithful children with great reward that will exceed what you have taken a multitude over and above your worthless actions.</p>
<p>And so shall it be. I will create a new heaven and a new earth wherein dwells righteousness, and my children will live with me, and I will make my dwelling among men, and so shall it be. But you will burn in your evil ways, and every evil thing you have done will be returned to you for eternity. And so I will set the seal, and you will be forgotten, and you will not come to mind. And all shall dwell in peace, and you will never have peace.</p>
<p>Behold, time is up, and I am sending my Son for his Bride, even Jesus Christ the Righteous! For in him I am well pleased! And all that he has saved and made whole from your worthless ways, even those you have accused unjustly, will rest in me and have perfect peace, joy, and love. For I will make you as them and make them more glorious than you once were, and you have no kingdom, for you are no king.</p>
<p>Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, for great wrath is on you. For you have rejected your creator and you love death. For to reject me is to love death, and in dying you shall die. My wrath is hot against you, and I will take all pleasures away, all joy, even your basic needs will go unmet. For when I showered you in grace and mercy, you chose instead to use grace as an occasion to join the worthless ones, even Satan's kingdom, when you could have escaped. And so now many will perish, whose names were never written in the Book of Life from the beginning. My Son, Jesus Christ, is approaching, and he will snatch his bride into the heavens, and I will remove the restrainer. Behold! I send giants to fulfill my wrath! You took my grace and mercy in vain and have lived lives of sinful pleasure, and I will repay.</p>
<p>For when you could have had peace for all eternity, even an eternal life of full joy and happiness, you chose your own deaths, and I will give you what you desire. You want a world of evil and darkness; I will give you exactly what you desire, and I will also recompense you for all the pain you caused others as you lived in great sin. I will strip from you all pleasure, and you will eat of the filth of your ways. Great judgment is on the earth, and there will be no more delay.</p>
<p>Behold! All who call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. For a great multitude will be saved from the tribulation that is coming, and I will receive them to myself. For it is written: These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his Temple: and he that sits on the Throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more, neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.</p>
<p>I urge you all to call on the name of Jesus Christ, the true Messiah, even the only begotten son of God, for he is coming. and the wrath of the Lamb and the wrath of Yahweh are about to be unleashed.</p>
<div class="indent">
<p>I am Yahweh, the great eternal God.</p>
<p>I am El Shaddai, God Almighty.</p>

<div class="quotedlink pt-header"><a href="/prophecy/the-unrighteous-shall-not-inherit-the-kingdom-of-god">The Unrighteous Shall Not Inherit the Kingdom of God!</a><span>Thunders 5 & 6 (April 19, 2024)</span></div>
<h2 id="all7-5"><span class="quotedlinknro readnro" id="nro5">5</span>From Yeshua HaMashiach: Thunder Five! </h2>
<p>My son, if thou will receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee; so that you incline your ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding. Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness: and know that I, the Lord Jesus Christ, am ever with you and am ever present in your lives as you hold on to me and my salvation, for I am the head of the Body, and I am your faithful Lord, my beloved Bride. For I have prepared a place and future for you, and there is great reward for my called, and faithful, and chosen.</p>
<p>I have not called you to loss and punishment nor have I called you to shame and self-condemnation; have you not read there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit? So believe my words! I did not call you to live in the shadow of your past sins, nor to live in the shadow of your youthful exploits, but I have called you to die to your old sinful ways and take up newness of life in me as you put off your flesh, as you put off your sins and walk in newness of life in me. Behold! I make all things new! Is this not your hope?</p>
<p>My children, I have taken you from the depravity of this current dying world, and I have delivered you from the power of darkness and have translated you into my kingdom, the kingdom of God, led by me, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, of which Yahweh is God, for there is no other. I have called you to glory and virtue in me, and I have rescued you from the kingdom of Satan, the kingdom of darkness, into my Kingdom, where there is light! So, awake you who sleeps, and arise from the dead, and I, Jesus Christ, will give you light.</p>
<p>Have you not read in the letters I sent to my Bride, that I sent to you, my very Church? Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</p>
<p>Do you not understand my precepts, oh, lukewarm church of Laodicea? I did not call you to return to your flesh, nor did I call you to continue in your unrighteous ways. Think, and consider; let him that thinks he stands, take heed lest he fall! Take heed to yourselves, and to the doctrine: continue in them: for in doing this, thou shalt both save yourself, and them that hear you. Understand, my lukewarm little ones, that you cannot live a life of compromise between good and evil, thinking you are upright before me, when you choose the lesser of two evils in your election rituals that I do not condone or endorse.</p>
<p>Come out of her, my people, as I have NOT provided a political solution, and I have absolutely not given you a world leader to make anything great again. You are deceived, and you are being primed to follow and give consent to the son of perdition who openly walks among you, although he has not been revealed quite yet. But you who ask for discernment will know who he is, so that you may avoid his deception. No, compromise is not for you, as you are my children and brethren, and I did not win your salvation by giving my life as a ransom for many by compromising with Satan; for to compromise is to join their ranks. So make no mistake: You either stand for me in righteousness and true holiness, or you have joined the ranks of Satan in his dying kingdom, so REPENT!</p>
<p>What do you gain by compromise with evil? Do you not understand that you are to overcome evil with good? So stand fast in me and quit flip-flopping like a fish out of water. Many of you are still blown about by every wind of doctrine and sleight of hand, whereby they lie in wait to deceive. I, Christ Jesus, have spoken, and I will not be silenced. So many of you have compromised yourselves and my church, and I ask you: how long halt you between two opinions? If the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. Simply stated, you cannot compromise and choose any form of evil and think you are standing for me; when you choose evil, you choose the sources of that evil as your lord and master becoming the servant of sin. Know ye not, that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey: whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</p>
<p>Hear me and hear me well, my Church; know that I stand in disgust at the practices that are prevalent in your nation and around the world, that you have compromised and allowed into my Church to vex my little ones. As in the days of Noah, so shall it be. The days of Noah were a time when the earth was ruled by evil abominations made by the fallen angels, their very own seed, a seed of evil made for your complete destruction: and they will return, for behold, I bring giants to fulfill my wrath. They accomplished this by removing and violating natural boundaries that my Father set in place so that peace and righteousness could prevail, but by removing and immorally crossing the very boundaries that are obvious in nature itself, that my Father instituted, many of you have polluted yourselves by your consent of the evil prevalent in your times. The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be: and that which is done, is that which shall be done; and there is no new thing under the sun. Have you not read, oh, ye of little faith? Removing God's own boundaries causes insanity, and sickness, and confusion of all things. Many of you revel in mental illness, thinking a man can become a woman and a woman can become a man, and you lead your own children into your delusions. Many of you attend churches led by homosexual false ministers who are open and flamboyant in their sickness, and you think they speak for me? Know this: if you are in that sinful state, I will give you over to the lusts you so wantonly crave, and you will reap the fruit of your unclean ways.</p>
<p>Behold! For this cause, God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one towards another, men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet. But no, it is not enough to be led by the effeminate and their lies; you allow your own children to be compromised and even mutilated before me.</p>
<p>There is great consequence in store for these actions, and they will not go unpunished. And yet you persist in your insanity, and unless you repent, I will spew you out of my mouth. Come to me in repentance, and sit in sackcloth and ashes, that I may know the sincerity of your repentance and weep and howl over your sins so that you do not pay the price in judgment. So many of you are so arrogant because you try to make me Lord while you still have a faithless heart, for with the heart man believes unto righteousness. So have faith that you may be saved; your faith will be indicated to all by your repudiation of sin and coming out of your filthy ways. The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted. But you still consent to the ways of the sodomite, and you help bring great evil on the land, to the point that you actually vote for child molesters to lead your lands. You lack even the most elementary level of discernment, and you do not follow my way; and if you persist, I will completely give you over to your vile affections for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved.</p>
<p>Let me open your eyes, you who are willingly ignorant and blind, you who sit in filth and darkness, rolling in the mire. You cannot give your consent to evil and think you are serving me, for I resisted evil and temptation until the very last drop of blood flowed from me onto the red earth, for I am the last Adam and I have been made a quickening spirit. So many of you are blinded by good words and fair speeches and give your full consent to criminals and horrible people who prey on children. They molest children, they torture children for their own evil lusts: For so comes the wrath of God on Mystery Babylon, but so many of you persist in giving your consent to these brute beasts who are set aside for the eternal hellfires that will never be quenched. Come out of her, my people, or you will share in her plagues and the awful judgment that is coming on her; and I have warned you. For what concord has Christ with Belial? If you share in her lies, you will share in her plagues; so completely separate yourselves in word and in deed, and do not agree with them in the least. Do not live careless, compromised lives; for I will punish all who do. You think because you have eternal life that you can't experience great loss and consequence? I will strip your rewards and give them away, and you will be the least in the kingdom of heaven if you persist, for so says Yeshua HaMashiach, the Bridegroom, to my Bride!</p>
<h2 id="all7-6"><span class="quotedlinknro readnro" id="nro6">6</span>From Yahweh, the Great Eternal God: Thunder Six!</h2>
<p>Oh, you worthless ones who harm my creation, you worthless ones who have sold yourselves to Satan, you worthless ones who have made Satan your God, you worthless ones who reject my son Jesus Christ and the salvation I have provided in his name, you worthless ones who have allowed your own children to burn in the fires of Moloch. I will give you the world you desire, and I have prepared you a world without me, a world without my son Christ Jesus, a world with a great lake of fire and brimstone just for you.</p>
<p>I will give you the darkness you so desire, for my light will not be present there, and you will spend eternity separated from me, Yahweh, the great brilliant God, whose glory and brightness no flesh can behold and who is from everlasting to everlasting. You rebellious, evil ones who have destroyed my creation from the beginning in your lusts and hate and jealousy, know that you have heaped great punishment and torment to yourselves from which you will never be healed and to all who are led astray by your lies and refusing Jesus Christ, refusing to turn from your lies to my truth.</p>
<p>You think that perverting my ways and removing my boundaries is a light thing, but you will understand my wrath as soon as the first flame touches you, and you will be engulfed in fire and brimstone of which you will never escape. Furthermore, you have murdered, raped, plundered, molested, hurt, killed, destroyed, and participated in the most grievous offenses, even desiring strange flesh; and you have joined yourselves to the fallen angels, so I will join you to the lake of fire that I have prepared for the Devil and his angels, and you will not escape. You have no peace.</p>
<p>I will exact justice on you, for I am a God of justice, and I am a God of vengeance. Yet, you will arrogantly stand against me, pleading your case, thinking that I will somehow shrink from your satanic ways of: do what you will, shall be the whole of the law. You have no peace. I will repay, and you say that I am a loving God (which I am), but then you expect me not to exact justice on those who have polluted my creation, on those who tortured and killed my only begotten son as he gave himself a ransom for all; yea, you expect me not to exact justice on you for your worthless ways when you have killed, tortured, and maimed the innocent and you have starved my little ones for your own agendas.</p>
<p>Indeed, Satan himself would destroy all that is of me for his own greedy gain, and even then you try and accuse me of folly in my righteous judgments when I come to protect my own. Your days of leading my little ones astray are about to come to an end. Behold! Your beast and false prophet will utterly be destroyed, and I will cast them alive into that great lake burning with fire and brimstone; they will wait for you to join them in your inheritance.</p>
<p>Great judgment is on you, oh, prince of darkness; your kingdom and all that follow you are about to be utterly destroyed. For you are no gods, and you cannot deliver your worthless selves from my hand, and I will chain you in the deepest darkness that you so desire, even the deepest abyss will I chain you with a great chain that you cannot break. Yea, in the abyss you will be for one day, for one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. And even then I will loose you for a little season that you may tempt and gather the very last of those abominable ones who would follow you and your ways. And I will then consume all of you with fire, and the thrones of judgment will be set, and I will judge all of you evildoers, and you will go to everlasting punishment from the face of the Lord. You will burn in the presence of the angels and in the presence of the lamb, and they will behold you in torment and punishment, for you have wronged them all, and you will fully pay for your sins for all eternity.</p>
<p>Then you will be sealed in your prison, and you will be forgotten, and you will never again come to mind, for the former things will pass away and be forgotten. For behold, I will make a new heaven and new earth wherein dwells righteous; and I, Yahweh, the great eternal God of all gods, for there is none like me, behold, I will make all things new, for I, Yahweh have spoken it! Yahweh, the great eternal God, will make his throne on earth, and my dwelling place will be amongst men, and you will never again be, oh, you worthless ones, and you will forever burn in your forgotten prison of torment that you can never escape, for I will set the seal and none can break it.</p>
<p>Yet, so many of you who sympathize with Satan accuse me of folly for taking justice and vengeance into my own hands to deliver those who made themselves worthy of everlasting punishment to the flames. Hear my words, oh, dwellers of the earth: my Son is coming, and he comes with great vengeance, anger, and fury for the wrongs done by your hands. The times of judgment, even the judgment of the great day of Christ is about to explode across the earth, and there will be no remedy for the evil ones, no remedy for Satan, and no remedy for all who have joined him, as all will go into eternal perdition, and I will give back to them all that they have inflicted on the innocent.</p>
<p>Therefore, I will inflict their evil hearts' desires and all their evil works right back on them for all eternity. See my anger boiling and know that the times of restitution of all things is at hand, and no numbers are left on the clocks in the heavens, for all the numbers have fallen from the clock face, for time is up! I counsel all who read these words to run to my son Jesus Christ in repentance and make him Lord; for no one will come to me except through Jesus Christ, for no other name have I given for salvation, and all of your idols will burn. There is time yet for salvation, and whosoever calls on the name of the Lord to the end will be saved. So run to Jesus Christ while you still can, for the day of the Lord has come, and I will unleash my Son, and the wrath of the Lamb will be satisfied. Kiss the Son lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little: Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.</p>

<div class="quotedlink pa-header"><a href="/prophecy/hear-me-and-hear-me-well">Hear Me and Hear Me Well!</a><span>Thunder 7 (May 1, 2024)</span></div>
<h2 id="all7-7"><span class="quotedlinknro readnro" id="nro7">7</span>From Yeshua HaMashiach: Thunder Seven!</h2>
<p>Hear me and hear me well, you false prophets who would pervert my holy Word, for you are not of me, and you have not my holy spirit, and you have attacked my Bride, even my Church whom I have called! Hear and heed my warning, oh, you faithless and crooked and perverse nation, for you will answer for every evil act! Hear my words of warning, those who lead my Church astray, for my wrath is hot against you, for I am the Lamb of God! For many of you will hide yourselves in the dens, and in the rocks of the mountains. And you will say to the mountains and rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: For the great day of his wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand?</p>
<p>For the world will see my appearing, and great shaking will come on all, and sudden destruction will overtake the earth as my Bride is snatched away into safety. For I will remove the restrainer, and all evil will be completely unrestrained, and great judgment will be cast down from the heavens, just as it is written in that great book of my revealing, even the book of Revelation! So I declare judgment against you, all who would pollute my Church: your days are numbered, and soon your hearts will fail you when my wrath is revealed. You worthless false prophets who have infiltrated my Church, you have taught syncretized witchcraft and occultism with my holy Word and holy ways, and you will pay.</p>
<p>You have caused my little ones to sin and be taken in great troubles, that I will return to you a hundredfold in my judgment on you. You have redefined words in my holy writings, you have counterfeited my holy writings by rewriting them and changing the words of the Eternal God, even Yahweh's words, and you will pay for all eternity. You have introduced corrupted texts into my Church in the same way that your worthless ancestors poisoned wells and have poisoned the very foods given for mankind's sustenance, and you will pay for all eternity. Every idle word you have spoken, every last denomination of filthy lucre you store to your own demise, every evil thought you have ever had, every evil motivation you ever pursued will be presented to you, and you will pay, even to the uttermost farthing; and you will in no way be able to stand before me, and you will take your place in the flames my Father has prepared for the Devil and his angels.</p>
<p>But understand that you are no marvel and there are no surprises in you, for you are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming yourselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel, for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore, it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness, whose end shall be according to their work. For so I have written to Corinth!</p>
<p>You will continue your works filling up your sins to the fullest and filling eternity to the fullest with your own punishment and torment, for my anger is fierce against you, and you will join your fathers in the fire. For you are the tares amongst the wheat, and I will root you out to the uttermost; for my Father, even Yahweh, has declared that you will never have root nor inheritance, for your seed is of the evil one, and you are all murderers and liars. For what did I tell your fathers in Judea these many Jubilees past? You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do: he was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</p>
<p>Know this, all you who have been born in blasphemy, even the blasphemy against Yahweh as your worthless fathers tried to morph the image of God, of which Adam was created, into abominations made for mankind's destruction, your days are almost up. For which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? And they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers. You will not escape, no matter how far you go into the earth to hide from my wrath; my wrath will find you, for nothing can be hid from my sight, and the earth is mine and the fullness thereof, for I have purchased it in my own blood that your ancestors blasphemously spilled, even sealing your own fate in the fires. Even I, Christ Jesus, the ascended and glorified one, I am coming for you, and you will not escape.</p>
<p>Hear me, oh, you fallen ones, even all of you who pierced me, for you said to yourselves, we have defeated Yahweh and killed his son whom he sent against us to subdue the earth, and we are victorious forever, for Yeshua is dead, and you foolishly rejoiced! You arrogant fools with no understanding! You didn't understand that God would raise me up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that I should be holden of it. You only bruised my heel, and you are powerless against me, and you understood not that the most high, even your creator, Yahweh, only showed you the worthless mysteries!</p>
<p>For he knew that you would turn on him and his creation and would try to take what he had prepared for me, the Lord Jesus Christ. My meek ones shall inherit the earth, for the earth is mine and the fullness thereof. For you have taught mankind forbidden knowledge; you taught war; you led women astray in beautifying of the eyelids with painted faces to fulfill your lusts on them; you corrupted the Garden of God by planting tares amongst the wheat, and every tare you planted for all time will be rooted out, bound, and cast into the fire with you! For you were defeated when I freely gave myself for the salvation of mankind, and God raised me from the dead to die no more!</p>
<p>But you were so unwise to not understand that I would give my life out of the love of God he created in me, for I am the savior of the world! Yahweh's love cannot be conquered, for Yahweh is unconquerable, and nowhere in creation is any being like him, for he is the most high, and his brightness and majesty is all powerful from eternity to eternity! For I told you, "this that thou doest do quickly!" You ignorantly and arrogantly did not understand that I allowed myself to be taken by your worthless hirelings who did the dirty deed of slaying the innocent blood! In your haughty ignorance, you failed to realize that I had twelve legions of angels at my command, for at any time I could have stopped you. But how else was the will of Yahweh to come to pass, except by my love and obedience to my Father? For Yahweh's love can no one overcome! No, not in heaven and not in earth, not in any way and not ever!</p>
<p>You fallen ones, even you princes of this fallen world, you Satans, you will all burn in unquenchable fire for your unholy hatred and your deeply evil ways of disobedience and destruction. As you did it to one of the least of these, my brothers, you did it to me. Oh, you fallen watchers, even you disobedient angels who left your first estate, you have no peace! You will be cast into the fire of which you will never depart, and you will utterly burn. All of your abominable unholy tares that you planted by crossing Yahweh's boundaries in your genetic manipulations between man and angel, between man and beast, between man and sea creatures, between beasts of various kinds, even every abominable thing that you have made will be cast into the fire with you, for you have no peace nor forgiveness!</p>
<p>You have followed the Satans who tried to destroy Yahweh's creation, even to the point of murdering me, Jesus Christ, when I willingly gave myself into his hands as the perfect Passover for the world, thereby sealing mankind's redemption and sealing your fate to eternity in the great fires that can never be quenched! You will utterly pay for all of your sins and abominations, and every evil deed you ever did will be turned on you a hundredfold, for all will be recompensed according to their works. And all your evil ways will be repaid on your own heads many times over, for you thought you could defeat me, and you arrogantly still think you can win when you are utterly defeated.</p>
<p>Hear my words, oh, ancient serpent, for your judgment is upon you and I see your fear, for you fear your future more than anything, oh, you worthless toothless lion! Vengeance is mine, and I will repay, and your times have come. The wrath of God and the wrath of the lamb are about to be unleashed as I will break the seven seals, as seven angels are sent to sound the trumpet judgments, and the seven angels are sent who have the seven last plagues, and they will be unleashed, for in them is filled up the wrath of God. Many woes will overtake you all, as I utterly punish and dismantle your kingdom. Your great king will I defeat and your false prophet will I defeat, and they will be cast alive into the lake of fire that burns with brimstone; and there they will wait for you to join them, and there will you ever be engulfed in fire and brimstone, and your judgment is about to begin!</p>
<p>My Bride, fear not! My words of judgment are not for you but for your comfort, for I have saved you from the wrath that is about to be unleashed, and I will hide you away in safety and great reward, and forever will you be with me. For I have chosen you, for I have called you, and you are my greatest treasure, and you are Yahweh's greatest treasure; you are even the pearl of great price, for I have given my all for you. I counsel my Bride to seek discernment and come to me for wisdom, for I will teach you. For some of you have followed some of the ways of these false prophets; only turn back in repentance to your Lord, and I will receive you.</p>
<p>For they have enticed you with Christian witchcraft, and you have believed many lies sold to you, even told you for truth, but they are abominable lies. These wells without water have tried to pull you from me, and that is impossible, so fear not, for I will not be denied! I will continue to free you so that you are free indeed, and I will not be silenced! I fight for you in so many, many ways of which you are unaware. For you were all marked before you were born, for the Father knew you even in your mother's womb, and he waited on each and every one of you for a length of time that you cannot comprehend, and you have always been at the center of his heart. You were marked at birth, and my angels kept you at my command and have guarded you and protected you, for so are they sent. Does this surprise you? Will you listen to what the Hebrews have to say? But to which of the Angels said he at any time, sit on my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool? Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them, who shall be heirs of salvation?</p>
<p>My Bride, you are heirs of salvation in me, Jesus Christ. You have been called in me; you have been protected in me and by me; you have been given the chance to hear the preaching of faith regarding me so that you could make me your Lord, and therefore I have sealed you with that holy spirit of promise. Know that the seal cannot be broken, and you are about to be fully redeemed into eternity, for you have no idea of the fullness of the creative work that I am about to consummate in you, my Bride! Know that the fallen ones and their tares are jealous of you, and they hate whatever Yahweh loves, and I will avenge you fully on their heads, for I am the one who will wound that ancient serpent's head, for it has been declared, and what Yahweh declares cannot be changed.</p>
<p>Nobody can separate you from me; no amount of evil can break that seal; you are mine and you are the Father's, for all that the Father gives me I will give back to God that we may be all in all! And he has given me all things in heaven and earth, except in his throne he is greater than I! </p>
<p>And I, Christ Jesus, declare these words to you, and it is I, Jesus Christ, who pronounces judgment on your enemies, and I will bring it to pass to the uttermost farthing. My Bride, my love for you is unquenchable, and I have prepared a place for you, for in my Father's house are many mansions! So very soon you will be married to me forevermore, and so shall you ever be with me, and you will finally understand the magnitude of your purpose in me that you have been created to fulfill!</p>
<p>For in me, Yahweh has given you a future and a purpose, even the purpose of the ages is about to be revealed to you, for I am coming! And I will not be denied. Look for my appearing. Look for my brightness of my coming, for it is soon to break over the earth as I appear in the clouds with a mighty shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, for I tell you truly that even the angels wait on that trump which is about to sound, and they are at the ready! Be ready for me and look, watch, observe as commanded; for you will soon see me and my glory that the Father has clothed me in, for so will I clothe you, for you will be like me, and you will see me as I am.</p>
<div class="indent">
<p>I am the Lamb of God!</p>
<p>I am coming to execute wrath on all of Satan's kingdom, and they will not escape.</p>
<p>I am the savior of the World!</p>
<p>I am Christ Jesus and vengeance is mine and I will repay!</p>
<p>I am the one who will wound the serpent's head, for God Almighty has declared it! I am about to be revealed in the clouds for my Bride, whom I will snatch away.</p>
<p>I am he who is coming on a white horse.</p>
<p>I am who is called faithful and true, and in righteousness I will judge and make war.</p>
<p>I am coming!</p>
