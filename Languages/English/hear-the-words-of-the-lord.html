<h1 id="ph">Hear the Words of the Lord: The Great Mystery Revealed!</h1>
<div id="prophecy">
<p>Yeshua HaMashiach says to his Bride: Take heed and hear my words, my chosen, and understand my speech, for great is the mystery of Godliness! So many of you have no concept of the great mystery of God, and yet it sets at the very heart and foundation for followers of the Way, both doctrinally and practically: It is the centerpiece of Christianity whereby I have created you in me, and you are a new creation in Christ Jesus, for I, Jesus Christ, have so made you.</p>
<p>For so many of you, the great mystery of God has been lost to time and tradition and the cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive. Fear not, my children, and hear my words and hear my speech, for I will explain it to you here in these last few minutes of the age. Understand, my children, that much confusion and many lies have been introduced into my church by ravenous wolves and their false doctrines. They have falsely divided my Word (and Body) via dispensationalism, and this is a huge lie brought about by those who built their houses on sand, and not me, the chief cornerstone, for without me no man can build.</p>
<p>The sand they choose to cornerstone their buildings is corrupt Bibles leading to ecumenical unity for purposes the man of sin has in his heart, purposes of control and death and destruction. The sand they used to build is comprised of corrupted texts, Greek texts that have been passed down from Alexandria. Follow the texts from the Antioch lines, the Byzantine, and these lead to the Textus Receptus, the great enemy of Rome. There are no dispensations, and God is not divided, though I will explain dispensation as it occurs in my epistles. God has dealt with mankind using ages; study to learn. So understand, these divisions are not of me but have been engineered to corrupt my Church from the beginning.</p>
<p>The great mystery has been hid from you, my children, but not concealed, for I revealed it to the Apostle Paul these many Jubilees ago. It is hidden through lies, deceit, erroneous doctrines that are not of me; but it is hidden in plain sight, and the thief would that you never noticed, but it is the elephant in the room. For what frightens Satan the most about my Church is that he knows he is powerless to control you when you walk in my full power and open-face relationship with me. Therefore, since he can't break the seal of God I have placed on you, and nobody can pluck you from my hands nor my Father's hands, he would instead try to suffocate you in poverty. Not material poverty; my Church should never have promoted the erroneous prosperity gospel because it is not of me, though many of you believe those lies. Satan desires spiritual poverty for you so that he can hide from you your true selves and entice you to believe you are a powerless doormat, forever destined to turn the other cheek and run like a coward, which is a misapplication of my precepts used to control my sons from walking in their true power. No, I have not sent you to turn the other cheek so that you can be victimized and overcome of evil; I sent you to overcome evil with good and to dismantle the works of the Devil, for so am I sent, and so have I sent you. But understand: vengeance is mine, so do not avenge yourselves, but turn the other cheek when appropriate for the salvation of another and to give place to wrath, for many souls have been saved in this manner.</p>
<p>Understand: they have deceived you with their lies, and they placed these lies that are in opposition to my truth right next to the holy writings. They did so in the margins of study Bibles; they did so using erroneous commentaries; they did this by sleight of hand by misaligned certain Greek definitions that are based in ancient pagan culture and not the truth of God's Holy Word. You may use these sources at times, but be very careful and stop letting natural man try to explain to you spiritual matters; for natural man cannot discern spiritual matters, for they are foolishness to him. Therefore, know that many of these charlatans who butcher scripture have no faith in the Word of God and are unqualified for the job they gave themselves because they have not the spirit of Christ and are not of me; for if they were of me, I would have led them in the truth. I am he who has sealed you for full redemption in the power of my holy spirit.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus Christ says to his beloved Bride: I need you to understand your true purpose, and if you do not understand the great mystery as it relates to you, then you will not walk in fullness of power that I have called you to walk in, but you will be diluted in your efforts as many of you have. It pains me and saddens my heart to see that my children do not understand their true selves and have no desire to search. You are always to search my words with all diligence; but false doctrines make many complacent, for there is no nutrition in them. For they are Satan's lies, but many live on fast food and sugar drinks, and most lack the energy to eat the food that I have given and to drink the drink that I have given, for in so doing you will never hunger or thirst again.</p>
<p>So hear my words, my complacent Bride; it is time to rise to your true calling and do the works I have prepared for you, and know that I will do many miracles by your hands as you walk for me in faith and true knowledge. For what did I say in my ministry to Israel back when I walked openly in Judea? For what is Luke's account on the matter: And he said unto them, Unto you, it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables. So understand, my apostles were chosen to receive the great mystery of God that I unveiled to them. They wrote it down, and I have protected the writings that you may know the truth of the matter.</p>
<p>Too many of you listen to the Judaizers who would bring you back under Torah. It's interesting to note that if it wasn't for the great mystery of God, most of you wouldn't know of the Torah; for it wasn't given to the Gentile nations but to ancient Israel to keep, to be their schoolmaster to bring them to me. For I am the fulfillment of the law, and those who zealously cling to Mosaic law seek to glorify their flesh and walk in their own righteousness, and they lack understanding that Torah is kept in full and to the letter by your identification with me. For I am the only one who was able to keep the law, and I, Jesus the Nazarene have fulfilled the law's righteous requirements. I ratified my accomplishments in my own blood, and I then washed you in the flowing waters of my spirit as you have been baptized into me.</p>
<p>For what did I have Paul tell the Corinthians? For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Judean or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. If you go about to keep the law, you will fail and you will miss your calling, as I have condensed the law into the two great commandments: And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment. And the second is like it, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. Know, my children, that there are no greater commandments than these, for in these the commandments are kept.</p>
<p>Understand: I explain all of this in the letters I sent to my churches in times past. So understand that I have unveiled the great mystery of God, and the prophets of old diligently searched and inquired of this mystery which they knew of, but it was not given for them to know. I wish you understood that although the cover of your Bibles says “Holy,” is not holy of its own merit, for it is but the cover of a book. What makes a Bible holy is that the books they bind contain Holy Scripture sent of the spirit to the children of the most High, sent by Yahweh, the great eternal God, for there is none like him. So hear my holy words with your whole soul! For what did Peter have to say for you, my children? Of which salvation the Prophets have inquired, and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you, searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.</p>
<p>My children, you are unknowingly living the down payment of the glory that should follow, and your full inheritance is about to be revealed to you in me, Christ Jesus, for soon you will be snatched away and fully glorified. So what is this mystery? And where do you find it? I will tell you, for I am the Lord Jesus Christ, who shepherds the flock, and I am the Bridegroom to my Bride, and you are living the great mystery of God, though so many of you walk in darkness in this matter. Fear not, I will give you understanding, and to the wise and humble I will give wisdom. But to those amongst you who will dismiss my words, you do so in opposition to me; and you are either for me or against me, there is no in between. For I counsel you all to learn of me, hear my words and do not dismiss my voice, for I have given you a future and a purpose in me. I am the good Shepherd: the good Shepherd gives his life for the sheep, and my sheep hear my voice, so stop following the hirelings who pretend they are me!</p>
<p>Behold! The spirit says: There are several mysteries within the Great Mystery of God! I will start with the Great Mystery, then I will speak of other mysteries therein. Before we go any further, wipe the dispensationalist fog from your spectacles and open your eyes to see: The Gospels as you know them, the works of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, are vital for all. These books show my fulfillment of the law to the letter, with nothing left undone. They reveal me in my coming to Israel. By obedience to the four gospels as they are known, you learn to walk as I walked, for so you are commanded. Nevertheless, they are not the only gospels; no, they are not the only good news concerning me.</p>
<p>For I gave the good news of the Great Mystery of God to the Apostle Paul in his letters to the church, sent from me to him to reveal to you. Will you scoff at this notion? Do you think I preach another gospel and that I am a false voice? Are you so used to following the voices of hirelings that you no longer know my voice? For those who would scoff, you should heed the voice of the Galatians when Paul stated: But I certify you, brethren, that the Gospel which was preached of me, is not after man. For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. Paul spoke faithfully the truth I gave him, and yet so many of you dismiss the words I gave him, even lessening the words with sayings like: Oh, that's just what Paul wrote, or, those are just the Pauline epistles; they aren't the words of Christ because they're not in red! You fool! You are in error; open your eyes to my light and truth! I gave Paul the gospel of the mystery. Are you so foolish to believe that there are only four relatively short works containing my Gospel?</p>
<p>Please hear the words of Christ Jesus, my children, for I will teach the willing. For great is the Mystery of Godliness and the gospel therein, for I did announce the good news of the mystery. But I will not leave you with the voice of just one witness; let every word be established in the mouth of two or three witnesses. For the letter I sent to the Romans would like a word with you: Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began. Paul's good news is the revelation of the mystery kept secret since the world began, just as Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John are the good news of my first coming to Israel.</p>
<p>I am the Faithful Lord and my words are true, so lend me your ear and especially your heart, for with the heart man believes unto righteousness. I ask you to have just the faith of a grain of mustard seed, for that seed will grow mightily in you with the proper care. For what did Paul say to the Corinthians: But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world, unto our glory. Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. It is plainly written, my children, and needs no explanation, but I will explain a little.</p>
<p>Do you understand these words, my children? Do you understand how precious you are that God has had his eye on you from before the creation of the world, and as he is eternal, and so are you, for you have been in the forefront of his mind since before time, and he has given you eternal life in me, Christ Jesus? Your times and lives are ordained by Yahweh, the great and spectacular God, whose brightness can no flesh behold. Had Satan known the Father's plans, he never would have crucified me, for in my obedience unto death and in my resurrection was consummated the power that defeated him and he is utterly ruined. He would never want a powerful church who are empowered by my spirit and of whom I do mighty works by their hands.</p>
<p>Does that resonate with you? Stop your mental consternation because my messengers tell you something you don't want to hear, and overcome your pride, for I will only lead the humble and I will resist the proud. Hear my words and let them sink into the depths of your souls; for I have created you in me, and you are mighty, and you are miraculous; for you are cleansed in my own blood, even the blood of the lamb. For I am the head of my Body who does many mighty works for my people that I am still calling, only hold to your Lord, Yeshua HaMashiach, in singleness of heart and unity of purpose, for I am Lord of Lords.</p>
<p>The faithful witness, and the first begotten from the dead says to his faithful and chosen! There was an ancient church in Ephesus, and to them was the fullness revealed of the Great Mystery of God in a letter sent by Paul from me, for he didn't speak of himself. I will explain a little, but know that I expect your obedience in faith to me, Jesus the Nazarene, and to whom much is given is much expected. Before I proceed, I want you to consider the following from Colossae, for I sent a letter to the Colossians as well: For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.</p>
<p>My children, you died when I died, and you die to yourselves daily by reckoning the old-man nature dead; for you were crucified with me, and in no other place in scripture will you find the mirror of your true selves, for no other section of gospels reveals it except the gospel of the Great Mystery I revealed to my Church. Even though you only see through a glass darkly, that is soon to change, and you will know as you also are known. Submerge yourselves in the Gospel of the Great Mystery of God, for my Laodicean church has lost my mysteries, for most of you seldom read my letters to the Church because the wayward shepherds led you elsewhere looking for words in red. My children, I know you love me, so love me according to knowledge, and walk not in deception.</p>
<p>So I ask you, what does the letter to the Ephesians have to say? For behold, the great mystery is there! Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he had purposed in himself, That in the dispensation of the fullness of times, he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth, even in him. I have made known to you the mystery of Yahweh's will, which he hid in himself, for he needs no counselor. Do not think of the counterfeit definition you learned from false prophets in their worthless margin notes regarding dispensations, for Satan stealthily redefines scriptural concepts to suit his will and plans that come to naught.</p>
<p>This mystery was given to Paul, and he was the steward entrusted with its dispensing to my Church, even to you if you have ears to hear and eyes to see. For the gospel of the Great Mystery was given to Paul, and I commissioned him on the road to Damascus. In the fullness of times, the Father will gather together all things which are in heaven and which are on earth in me, Christ Jesus. There will be no more division, no more separation between God and his children, no more enmity between Jew and Gentile, for you are all born again and are a new creation in me, Christ Jesus. Are these words too wonderful for you? Do my words cause you to bristle against them because you believe the wayward shepherds' interpretation of them?</p>
<p>Learn of me in humility so that you can understand. Again, in Ephesians Paul wrote the words I gave him: For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God, which is given me to you-ward: How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery. Again, don't get tripped up on the words of the false prophets, as the dispensation of the grace of God was his ministration to the Church, for he (and others) were chosen as stewards of the mysteries of God.</p>
<p>And again: Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy Apostles and Prophets by the Spirit, That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ, by the Gospel. Yes, read it correctly and read it again: the Gentiles who believe on my name holy name, even Jesus Christ, are fellow heirs and of the same body as those of Israel who have made me Lord, for there is no difference in me.</p>
<p>And again: Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages, and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints, To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. Yes, you are born again of my spirit, and my spirit permanently dwells in my children, for it is the spirit of sonship, the down payment of your inheritance, and that spirit embodies all of the abilities I have given you, for I have given gifts unto men. You are fashioned in my image, and you are created newly in me; for the Father has begotten you in me, for I am a life-quickening spirit.</p>
<p>Christ Jesus the ascended says: My little children, take great comfort in me, for my salvation, once achieved by making me your Lord in faith and repentance, cannot be lost or undone; for which of you can undo the natural creation of your traits in your own children, though they may lose inheritance if you were to disown them. Salvation is a gift given by my Father through me, Yeshua HaMashiach, and the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. Now, I will give you breadcrumbs to follow on your journey into the mysteries contained within the great Mystery of God, so study to show yourselves approved to God, a workman of the Word, rightly dividing the word of truth, that you may not be ashamed before me at my coming.</p>
<p>There is the mystery in Romans, considering Israel's blindness in part. There is the mystery of the gathering of my bride, which some call rapture, and that is in Corinthians (and elsewhere); for in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, the last trump shall sound, and its sounding is upon you. Then there is the mystery of a husband and wife becoming one flesh, and this is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church, and you may find that in Ephesians. For I will take blindness from Israel when they turn their hearts to me. For I will gather my Bride to me, for I am the Bridegroom. I am he to whom you will be married, that we may forever be one in me and in my Father, for God is all in all. My heart rests on you, my children, and soon you will see me face to face; and make no mistake, I am calling you to me, my wise virgins, and I am coming for you so very soon, and I long to see you all where we will be face to face, and you will know, even as you are known.</p>
