<h1 id="ph">The Order of Melchizedek: The Mantle Passed, Abeyance, and Restoration</h1>
<div id="prophecy"> 
<h2>From Yahweh, The Great I AM:</h2>
<p>Hear the Words of Yahweh the great eternal God and allow me to impart wisdom to the wise man amongst you. And so I give you to understand The Order of Melchizedek, even which order Christ Jesus is ordained High Priest, even after the order of Melchizedek forevermore! Yet so it is that by mankind's sins, my ways have been forgotten, and many covenants have been abandoned, and much darkness and unlearned ways have overtaken the earth on account of the lies of the fallen ones. And this because of intentional lies and those who seek to suppress the truth in their unrighteous ways and in their spurious lies by which the world is captivated by their great deception that has come upon the entire world. Even a deception in part that supposes all life to come from some random imagined big bang given to indoctrinate mankind to the fallen one's lies who endeavor to hide Yahweh, the Great I AM, from the world that I have created by my own hand.</p>
<p>And I AM the Lord of Spirits, and I AM the Ancient of Days who truly, truly is he that existed before days were made and I AM he who created the holy angels of whom it is written: He makes the spirits his messengers, and his ministers a flame of fire, even when creation was created and brought forth out of the treasures of my eternal heart that works all things after the counsel of my own will. For of a truth I knew that Adam would willingly sin even before Adam sinned and that corruption would fall from heaven in the persons of the fallen ones. Wherefore, I did devise my eternal plan for Adam's full redemption placed fully in the face of Jesus the Christ who is also Yeshua HaMashiach in his New Testament of righteousness and truth!</p>
<p>And after the likeness and image of the last Adam will mankind be redeemed into everlasting joy and peace, where they will fulfill in love the eternal purposes of Yahweh, The Great I AM. Of a truth, my creation was created and made in love that my creations might come to me in love for all I have given them in my love for them. And that my creation might walk hand in hand with me in my eternal purposes in fulfillment of my eternal will, and in turn they will have perfect and full joy, peace, and eternal life even as they are led forth in peace by the hand of my Chief Shepherd, Jesus the Nazarene, without whom no man may approach Yahweh, The Great I AM, any longer, for so have I declared.</p>
<p>And the fallen ones have spread their lies over the face of my creation with the result the earth is now saturated in their deceptions, wherewith, they lie in wait to deceive. Even deceptions that have come fully as a result of the mystery of iniquity that has survived the flood of Noah by way of the fallen one's spurious knowledge that they gave to natural man for his complete and total destruction. No matter, because I do send all those who have pleasure in unrighteousness strong delusion that they all might be damned who reject the knowledge of the truth in favor of the fallen ones spurious lies. Yet so it is, that natural man ignorantly seeks to plead his case of self-made righteousness before my eternal and righteous gaze, therefore, understand that no flesh is justified in my sight because of the corruption in your blood due to sin in the flesh. Because the life of the flesh is in the blood!</p>
<p>For this reason was the son of Yahweh made manifest to the inhabitants of the earth, that by the redeeming sacrifice of the lamb of God, Adam would be redeemed in full salvation from his impending judgment for all those who are obedient to my peace treaty between myself and mankind who is Jesus the Nazarene who has been made a life giving spirit by the power of my hand. And also, by The Lion of the Tribe of Judah, who I am sending to the earth in righteousness to judge and make war and so the creation will be forcefully recovered from the hands of the squatters who are ever rebellious and do seek to stop my eternal will, of which stoppage is eternally impossible, because who is there who can stand against my mighty hand? And in their numbers, and in their evil, and in their schemes, and in their wiles, and even in their worthless technologies (of which they boast) the fallen ones are utterly defeated by the sacrifice of the lamb of God, who offered his sinless blood as the High Priest forever after The Order of Melchizedek in all obedience to he who sent him, even Yahweh, the Great and Eternal I AM!</p>
<p>And of his kingdom will there never be an end, because in all righteousness and true holiness has he purchased the earth in his own redeeming blood that a righteous rule may come over the earth in its time and that we may enjoy a day of rest (because a thousand years with Yahweh is as a day and a day as a thousand years in my sight), even a sabbath days rest before that old serpent is eternally cast to the flames in complete and eternal agony never to come to mind again and before that great white throne judgment is set to occur. And it is by the function of the high priest of The Order of Melchizedek that Adam has been redeemed from corruption by way of Jesus the Nazarene who did offer his eternal sacrifice in agonizing torment to pay the penalty of Moses that my eternal laws may be satisfied by which my eternal creation is ruled perfectly in righteous redemption.</p>
<p>And truly it will come to pass that I will create a new heaven and a new earth because the first heaven, and the first earth will pass away, and there will be no more sea; neither will there be anyone who would trouble you forevermore. And it will come to pass so suddenly now that my overcomers shall inherit all things, and I will be their God, and they shall be my sons. But the fearful and unbelieving, and the abominable and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake, which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.</p>
<p>Therefore, who is it you should fear my children, because you have been made children of the living God by the works of Yeshua HaMashiach who is also Jesus the Christ, even he whom I have empowered above all in my creation, except in my throne do I retain my authority, therefore who can stand against the mighty hand of Christ Jesus, The resurrected and ascended Lord? Truly, truly, as it has been and, as it is, and so will it be eternally and forevermore that Yahweh and Yeshua HaMashiach are one in unity and purpose and I have empowered him fully in all righteousness and he it is whom I have given charge over the entire host of heaven, and he does rule in perfect obedience to my eternal will. And so I give you to understand the trickery that has come over the earth, even the lies of the fallen ones who would seek to hide the truth of your salvation and the truth of your eternal Lord, Christ Jesus!</p>
<p>Therefore, understand that your Jesuit indoctrinators have caused blindness to fall on your hearts by hiding the truth of my creation and by hiding your true history from you, that you may wander in darkness fulfilling their evil lusts, even so that my doves would join them in their eternal inheritance of burning and rolling brimstone for so is their intent. And so it is that Yahweh, the Great I AM, has never left myself without witness. And with each covenant I have given, and with each testament I have given and accepted, I have never left myself without clear scriptural witness and direction given by the voices of my prophets of old, whom I ordained. And also given by the voices of the prophets of The New Testament that Yeshua HaMashiach has ordained who will serve him as his mighty priests and kings!</p>
<p>For so is The Order of Melchizedek, even an eternal order given to mankind, whereby the rule that Adam was to exert on the earth was one to be ruled by he who is ordained high priest, king, and prophet! For so was (and is) The Order of Melchizedek given to mankind, even so mankind would have a righteous rule even in spite of that old serpent who did beguile Eve in his subtlety. And so also did the Order of Melchizedek continue on, even resting on Adam from the start to whom it was given, yet in dying did they eventually die and the order of Melchizedek was passed on-wards for a time, in the days from Adam to Jacob.</p>
<p>And so in the World that then was before the great deluge The Order of Melchizedek passed from Adam, to Cainan, to Enos, to Enoch, to Methuselah, to Noah and so did the Order of Melchizedek pass in the days before the great flood. Yet, your Jesuit educators have rewritten scripture, and done much sleight of hand in order to hide the truth of Adam's true history even as they endeavor to make mankind an insignificant spec of dust in their false universe which supposedly came from a big bang somewhere in their imagined past.</p>
<p>Because Jesuits preach another Jesus, even a Jesus who was made in the image of Nimrod from Babylon, who was the first ruler of his type after the flood. And even though my righteous rulers ordained of old under the Order of Melchizedek did offer mankind righteousness instead of sin, suffering, death, and eternal punishment. Natural man nevertheless usually chooses sin, suffering, death, and eternal punishment. Nevertheless, all in my creation who have been endowed with free will are free to choose for themselves whether they will live unto Yahweh by way of Christ Jesus, or in turn choose their own eternal punishment for the pleasures of sin for a short season. And so it is written that all from the world that then was except eight souls were saved alive on account of Noah, who was a righteous man who ruled the earth after The Order of Melchizedek for a time because in dying he did die.</p>
<p>Therefore, understand the ways of the fallen ones, that they do with all their hearts seek to distort, lie, and hide the truth from my doves, even those whom I have ordained to eternal life. And so it is that as my plan of salvation for Adam was incrementally unveiled, I did send holy writings by the spirit of prophecy that did rest on them, and even the spirit of prophecy that was eventually born into the sons of God by the new birth given in the New Testament of Yeshua HaMashiach, even in he who I am always well pleased. And as I unveiled my plan incrementally, I also gave holy writings incrementally, and Christ Jesus has given holy writings received from my own hand, even he who works all things after the council of my own will.</p>
<p>And so do the fallen one work to corrupt the truth, even in similar manner as they corrupted themselves eternally and forevermore. Because they have rewritten scripture, they have given false study Bibles, they have given false lexicons and concordances whereby many are deceived with profane definitions thereby, as if Yahweh is incapable of providing capable translators to translate my Word because my Word cannot be broken nor hidden, though they try. Truly, it is the glory of Yahweh to conceal a matter and the honor of Kings to search it out! Therefore, I command you to search out the truths of Yahweh in the face of Yeshua HaMashiach!</p>
<p>So understand that those who serve that great harlot, even your Jesuit indoctrinators, have chosen a carefully selected tapestry of loosely interrelated lies whereby they lie in wait to deceive. They have hidden many holy testimonies and they have rewritten many Bibles based on false texts and have made many spurious lies regarding the truth of my creation. And in my foreknowledge and judgments I allowed the fallen one to do so, because had my holy writings been properly guarded and maintained even as instructed and entrusted, such foolishness could never have been accomplished. But so are the ways of sinful man and so are the ways of the fallen ones who lead mankind astray in his ever burning evil lusts. Even still, my Word cannot be broken and it will accomplish that thing whereto it is thereby sent to accomplish.</p>
<p>And so it is written in Jasher that after the great flood the mantle of Melchizedek remained on Noah and was eventually transferred to Shem who was the sixth in succession to wear the mantle and in time the order of Melchizedek was transferred to Abram who in time became the Father of many nations, and to his heirs of promise do the promises of inheritance go for fulfillment because the son of the bond woman shall not be heir of the promises because flesh and blood cannot inherit the promises of the Kingdom of God but the just who live by faith, even as faithful Abraham lived in the days of old.</p>
<p>Therefore, I give you to understand the meaning of Melchizedek which means King of Righteousness. And so the etymology is transliterated Hebrew into English where Melek means King and Zedek means righteousness with the given and intended meaning being King of Righteousness. And so have these righteous Kings ruled my creation, even righteous men who waited on their Messiah, even he who would be born from the tribe of Judah.</p>
<p>And as it is written in Hebrews by the hand of Paul (who was a steward of mysteries for Christ Jesus) and so he wrote: For this Melchizedek was King of Salem, the Priest of the most high God, who met Abraham, as he returned from the slaughter of the Kings, and blessed him: To whom also Abraham gave the tithe of all things: who first is by interpretation King of Righteousness: after that, he is also King of Salem, that is, King of peace, without father, without mother, without kindred, and has neither beginning of his days, neither end of life: but is likened unto the Son of God, and continues a Priest for ever. And so was the mantle of Melchizedek passed to faithful Abraham in its preservation even an order preserved and intended for Jesus the Christ who is also Yeshua HaMashiach.</p>
<p>Yet, so many of you have believed the lies of your Jesuit indoctrinators who have blinded many of you with learning against learning that these verses refer to Jesus the Christ himself and not The Order of Melchizedek itself. Because clearly, Jesus the Nazarene has a Father, even Yahweh the Great I AM, and clearly Jesus the Nazarene does have a mother, even Mary who was from Nazareth of Galilee who said be it unto me according to your will, even an eternal example of faith given that the faithful may know the ways of faith which they walk. Because clearly Jesus the Nazarene has kindred of whom he is kinsman redeemer, why do you not respect my clear Words given in scripture intended to guide you safely away from their spurious lies? And yet so many of you believe these lies over the clarity and precision of my Words.</p>
<p>Yet, so it is written that Shem remained faithful to Noah, because Ham forsook the Noahic covenant utterly and forgot the ways of Yahweh and Ham and many grandsons of Noah did endeavor to build their great city and tower as Nimrod's unrighteous kingdom arose to rule the earth in those days in unrighteousness, according to the ways of the fallen ones who he did serve, although I did work many times to give Nimrod the choice to return to me in repentance, a choice he refused eternally and forevermore.</p>
<p>Yet so it is written clearly in Jasher concerning Abram and Shem who passed the mantle to Abram at his slaughter of Chedorlaomer and his forces: And when he returned from smiting these kings, he and his men passed the valley of Siddim where the kings had made war together. And Bera king of Sodom, and the rest of his men that were with him, went out from the slime pits into which they had fallen, to meet Abram and his men. And Adonizedek (or Melchizedek) king of Jerusalem, the same was Shem, went out with his men to meet Abram and his people, with bread and wine, and they remained together in the valley of Melech. And Adonizedek (or Melchizedek) blessed Abram, and Abram gave him a tenth from all that he had brought from the spoil of his enemies, for Adonizedek (or Melchizedek) was a priest before God.</p>
<p>Yet so is it written in Jasher: And the days of Sarah were one hundred and twenty-seven years and she died, and Abraham made a great and heavy mourning, and he performed the rites of mourning for seven days. And all the inhabitants of the land comforted Abraham and Isaac his son on account of Sarah. And when the days of their mourning passed by Abraham sent away his son Isaac, and he went to the house of Shem and Eber, to learn the ways of the Lord and his instructions, and Abraham remained there three years. Thus so did the mantle of Melchizedek pass to Isaac who did pass the birthright of the firstborn to the younger, because Esau despised the things of God and sold his birthright for a bowl of pottage: Even a decision that Yahweh has eternally accepted.</p>
<p>Yet so is it written in Jasher concerning The Order of Melchizedek: And after this Shelach the son of Arpachshad died in that year, which is the eighteenth year of the lives of Jacob and Esau; and all the days that Shelach lived were four hundred and thirty-three years and he died. At that time Isaac sent his younger son Jacob to the house of Shem and Eber, and he learned the instructions of the Lord, and Jacob remained in the house of Shem and Eber for thirty-two years, and Esau his brother did not go, for he was not willing to go, and he remained in his father's house in the land of Canaan.</p>
<p>Yet so is it written in Jasher concerning the Order of Melchizedek, that in time I, Yahweh the Great I AM, revealed to Jacob that the order of Melchizedek was to be broken into three offices even according to the Words recorded in Jasher that you may know the truth of my Words: And Reuben was jealous for his mother Leah on account of this, and he was filled with anger, and he rose up in his anger and went and entered the tent of Bilhah and he thence removed his father's bed. At that time the portion of birthright, together with the kingly and priestly offices, was removed from the sons of Reuben, for he had profaned his father's bed, and the birthright was given unto Joseph, the kingly office to Judah, and the priesthood unto Levi, because Reuben had defiled his father's bed.</p>
<p>And so it was and so it has been written that the responsibilities contained in The Order of Melchizedek were set aside in favor of the direction of The Testament of Moses, under whose Testament of Old provided three separate and distinct offices for these holy functions, thus Israel had a lineage of Kings, and had the Office of Levitical priesthood, and had the school of prophets, even a school modeled after the school of prophets of old, from the days before the flood.</p>
<p>So the responsibilities and orders of Priest, King, and Prophet all passed through Israel according to their genealogies listed in the holy writings and in time, there came a man named John who was born of Zechariah who was of the priestly line of Zadok. And thus it behooved John the Baptist to fulfill all righteousness when he baptized the lamb of God in the river Jordan where Jesus was baptized, and came straight out of the water. And lo, the heavens were opened to him, and John saw the spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him. And lo, a voice came from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</p>
<p>And thus was Jesus the Nazarene ordained a priest forevermore after The Order of Melchizedek and all offices have been restored under the mantle of this eternal priesthood, both now and forevermore.</p>
<p>Because the Order of Melchizedek is a priestly order, of which mantle will not pass from Yeshua HaMashiach, because he is risen to die no more!</p>
<p>Because the Order of Melchizedek is an order of Kings for the righteous rule of my creation.</p>
<p>Because the Order of Melchizedek is an order for Prophets who speak and teach the history, ways, and future of Yahweh's plans of perfection given in the face of Jesus the Christ.</p>
<div class="indent">
<p>I AM YHVH, even the Great I AM and I have sent these Words by my messenger and servant and by my messenger and servant have these Words been sent. Of a truth, to my messenger and servant who serves under Christ Jesus his eternal Lord and by way of the spirit of prophecy has Yahweh and Christ Jesus revealed to our messenger and servant The Everlasting Gospel for the obedience and salvation of all these Words are sent. And the Words of The Everlasting Gospel will find the eyes, ears, and hearts of all to whom they are sent.</p>
<p>I AM YHVH, even he who has created, made and sent my only begotten Son, even Yeshua HaMashiach who is Jesus the Messiah for the salvation of all who are born of Adam and accept full redemption should those who are called answer their savior when he calls. Therefore, understand that it is I, YHVH, The Great I AM who reveals Jesus the Nazarene to the lost, even so that their Chief Shepherd may find and recover all of my lost sheep into my barns of safety and refuge eternally and forevermore.</p>
<p>I AM YHVH, even he who divided the eternal priesthood of Melchizedek into three separate and distinct offices of King, Priest, and Prophet under Jacob in his times.</p>
<p>I AM YHVH, even he who has restored the eternal Priesthood of Melchizedek in Christ Jesus, of whom it is written: For it is evident, that your Lord sprung out of Judah, concerning the which tribe Moses spake nothing, touching the Priesthood. And it is yet a more evident thing, because that after the similitude of Melchizedek, there is risen up another Priest, which is not made priest after the law of the carnal commandment of old, but after the power of the endless life. For he testifies thus, You are a Priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek. For the commandment that went before, is disanulled, because of the weakness thereof, and unprofitable-ness.</p>
</div>
<p>For the Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope made perfect, whereby we draw near to Yahweh. And for as much as it is not without an oath (for these are made Priests without an oath: But this is made with an oath by him that said to him, Yahweh has sworn, and will not repent, You are a Priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek) By so much is Jesus made a surety of a better Testament. And among them many were made Priests, because they could not continue, by the reason of their death. But this man, because he continues forever, has a Priesthood, which cannot pass from one to another. Wherefore, he is able also perfectly to save them that come unto God by him, seeing he ever lives, to make intercession for them.</p>
<p>Therefore, I give you to understand The Eternal Order of Melchizedek and the truth of Yeshua HaMashiach, who is also Jesus the Christ because under his eternal mantle of high priest after The Order of Melchizedek will Christ Jesus coronate and consecrate a mighty host of kings and priests under The Order of Melchizedek and thereby will the Kingdom of Heaven be ruled by the eternal hand of their Everlasting Lord of Righteousness, under whom they will perfectly in righteousness and true holiness rule forevermore, because regarding Christ Jesus Kingdom, there is never an end.</p>
<p>Selah!</p>
