<h1 id="ph">Reject The Mark of the Beast!</h1>
<div id="prophecy"> 
<p>Hear the voice of wisdom and bow the knee and hear the living voice of Yeshua HaMashiach, for I am the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, and I am King of Kings and Lord of Lords! El Shaddai, even the Almighty God, has highly exalted me and given me a name above every name. That at the Name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth: And that every tongue should confess, that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of the Father of Lights, even Yahweh, the everlasting and eternal God, for there is none like our Father!</p>
<p>Hear the voice of your Lord and understand things that are already underway and things that are soon to happen, for behold I am he who speaks of things to come as if they have already occurred for surely your great Lord, even me Christ Jesus the preeminent one will do nothing, except I reveal my secrets to my servants the Prophets. Why do you hearken to so many contradictory voices, and why halt you between two opinions? Have I not stated that my prophets speak in unison and will never contradict my holy Words?   For I am the Word made flesh who dwells among you by my holy spirit that is born within you forevermore, for each and every soul who is born again is sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is my incorruptible seed and the seal of the Living God cannot be broken. And the day of redemption of the purchased possession is at hand and your full redemption is here.</p>
<p>Thus says the Lord of Hosts, hear not the words of the prophets who prophesies to you, and teaches you vanities: they speak the vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord. Come to me my children because the anointing which you have received of me, abides in you: and you need not that any man teach you: But, as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is true, and is no lie: and even as it has taught you, you shall abide in me. My children abide in me and compare the words of anyone who claims to speak for me with scripture and ask me to confirm in your spirit, if perhaps you will listen to my voice for many of you are hard of hearing, and many of you love false words that tickle your ears so you may appear wise but instead follow the false words of presumptuous fools.</p>
<p>Behold! I speak of the times of Jacobs trouble that is ready to break across the entire earth. For judgment is already underway and cannot be stopped, for what Yahweh declares can no one change! Many, many tears have I cried over Mystery Babylon's judgment and I have sent my prophets for many, many years now and have even sent strangers from strange lands to witness and prophecy of the judgments that were approaching but are now here.</p>
<p>For so it will be for so it is written: The ten horns which you saw upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate, and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. For God has put in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled. And the woman, which thou saw, is that great city which reigns over the kings of the earth.</p>
<p>Hear my words, Secret Babylon's judgment is already underway. The ten horns have prepared their surprise attack and their attack approaches and is at your door. For even your media seeks to soothe you to sleep and many sit in darkness blind to reality saying: I sit as a Queen and am no widow and will see no mourning. Tomorrow will be as today, for today is as yesterday. In as much as she glorifies herself, and lives in pleasure, so much give to her torment and sorrow: Therefore shall her plagues come at one day, death, and sorrow, and famine, and she shall be burnt with fire: for Yahweh who condemns her, is the Almighty God and there is none greater and there is nothing that can stop El Shaddai's mighty hand!</p>
<p>And so the sun will soon rise on a day of calamity you do not expect, and that day is nearer than you imagine. And that day will bring utter destruction on Mystery Babylon, for she has a double portion of judgment declared against her. Her crimes and fornication are many and her penalty lingers not and great punishment will fall on the unrepentant even as my faithful Church and even my faithful Bride will be gathered to me suddenly in the clouds and saved from wrath, even the great trouble of Daniel's seventieth week. Babylon the Great is Fallen, is Fallen! Hear my words for I speak as if it is already happened for nothing will change, slow, hinder, nor stop Yahweh's judgments from crashing onto the earth.</p>
<p>In one hour she will be burned with fire, some of her cities will burn, some of her cities will be violently flooded, her towers will fall and break in many pieces, her bridges will fall, and much shaking will occur. The earth will be torn asunder violently and much land will be covered over in violent waters. Her skirts will be covered from the east and from the west in great waves and up the middle rushing waves and violent shaking. Of what remains will be a wasteland and never again will she rise, for this nation of many states and many cities shall never rise again and great will be her fall! For the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof, and all aspects of her evil influence will forever be erased from the nations during Daniel's seventieth week, for so I will cleanse the earth in my wrath. I, Christ Jesus, the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, have declared these words, and preparation for their fulfillment is already underway and will suddenly be fulfilled in one hour.</p>
<p>And so war will break across the earth as part of the surprise attack on Secret Babylon, for this is planned and coordinated for many jubilees now, for the mystery of iniquity has been at work since the days of old and will reach full consummation once the restrainer is removed as my faithful are taken into the heavens. War will fall across the earth and will come onto all peoples and all nations, for this is the third such war, as the fallen ones seek to destroy the old orders of the world and replace all things with their new order, even the order of the Dragon. The beast from the sea and the beast from the earth will rise in great fury, and they will make war with the saints, for it is given to them to overcome the saints. So it will be that all who love not their lives and call on the name of the Lord till the end shall be saved into everlasting joy into the eternity of eternities. And I Jesus the Nazarene have left an eternal example of obedience unto death, for my obedience to Yahweh was even the death of the cross as I suffered and paid for the sins of mankind as the lamb of God and behold I am coming as the Lion of the Tribe of Judah and I will not be stopped nor hindered!</p>
<p>And so my two prophets who are the two olive trees and two candlesticks who stand before the God of the earth will prophesy for 42 months clothed in sackcloth, for they were taken into the heavens in the times of old. And if any man will hurt them, fire proceeds out of their mouth, and devours their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed. These have power to shut heaven, stopping the rain in the days of their prophecies: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.</p>
<p>Theirs is an everlasting testimony, and they will declare the everlasting gospel, and they will speak of the plans of Yahweh for all times, and they will speak for me Christ Jesus, and many mysteries will they reveal and they will turn the hearts of many to the Father of Lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning. They will witness of me Yeshua HaMashiach for it is I that Yahweh has sent to Israel to fulfill the promises made to their Fathers and I am the true Messiah now and forevermore and of my kingdom there is no end! For what times have ever been where Yahweh has left himself without witness? There has NEVER been a time Yahweh has left himself without witness, and all who are ordained to everlasting salvation will come to be saved into everlasting eternity and everlasting joy, for the fulfillment of all things is already underway.</p>
<p>And so the beast from the sea will rise as well as the beast from the earth, who is also the false prophet. And he will open his mouth speaking great blasphemies against Yahweh to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven. And it will be given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them and power will be given to him to rule every kindred, and tongue, and nation for he will lead the world. The beast from the earth will also rule the land as their false Moshiach and will be their temple builder. The beast from the sea will rule according to their blasphemous Noahide laws as they seek to eradicate anything to do with the true God and his only begotten son Jesus Christ from the face of the earth.</p>
<p>The beast from the earth will cause the earth to worship the beast, whose deadly wound was healed. And he will do great wonders to deceive them that dwell on the earth, for it will be permitted for him to do many lying signs and wonders, and he will cause fire to come down on the earth in the sight of men and he will lead all men to wonder after them. But he is an adversary, and exalts himself against all that is called God, or that is worshiped: so that he does sit as God in the Temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.</p>
<p>And he will make an image of the beast and will cause all to worship the image which he will make. And it will be permitted to him to give a spirit to the image of the beast so that the image of the beast should speak and will cause all who will not worship the image of the beast should be killed. And he will make all, both rich and poor, free and slave, to receive his mark in their right hand or in their foreheads.</p>
<p>And so I say again to those who dwell on the earth that all may hear:</p>
<div class="indent">
<p class="spectral">IF ANY MAN WORSHIP THE BEAST AND HIS IMAGE, AND RECEIVE HIS MARK IN HIS FOREHEAD, OR IN HIS HAND, THE SAME SHALL DRINK OF THE WINE OF THE WRATH OF GOD, WHICH IS POURED OUT WITHOUT MIXTURE INTO THE CUP OF HIS INDIGNATION, AND HE SHALL BE TORMENTED WITH FIRE AND BRIMSTONE, IN THE PRESENCE OF THE HOLY ANGELS, AND IN THE PRESENCE OF THE LAMB: AND THE SMOKE OF THEIR TORMENT ASCENDS UP FOR EVER AND EVER. AND THEY HAVE NO REST DAY NOR NIGHT, WHO WORSHIP THE BEAST AND HIS IMAGE, AND WHOSOEVER RECEIVES THE MARK OF HIS NAME.</p>
</div>
<p>The world that now is will never be again, and the rising kingdom of the Dragon will be utterly cast down, as Satans kingdom moves towards its final end, for they are squatters and they are no kings. And this is the world that many will find themselves, even those who survive the coming cataclysms and war. Take not the mark my people, for they will come offering peace, they will come offering safety, they will tell you it's all for your own good. They will launch their so called pandemics for they have already planned to convince the world they are sick. And all manner of pestilence and disease and plagues will abound for so are the effects of the coming horseman and they will ride! </p>
<p>They will offer health and healing from the judgments of God, when instead man should repent of his wickedness. They will offer entrance into their society from the awful judgments that are about to break across the earth. For I Christ Jesus will tell you before it happens that you may know the sincerity of my words and that you may navigate the perilous waters of which many will find themselves, even those with the courage to call on my name to the end, for they are heirs of eternal salvation. For all who call on Jesus the Nazarene as their Lord, even all who call on my mighty name and love not their lives till the end, will be saved into everlasting life.</p>
<p>Have you not read? These are they which will came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore, are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his Temple: and he that sits on the Throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore, neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them to living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.</p>
<p>However, even though a multitude of multitudes will be saved from Daniel's seventieth week and salvation will come to Israel for yet a remnant will bow to me Yeshua HaMashiach, (For I am the true Messiah in whom the lamb of God will give way to the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, and they will both be consummated in everlasting harmony in me, for in me Christ Jesus the Lion will lie down in peace with the lamb.) sadly, and unnecessarily, most of the world will wonder after and follow these beastly rulers, for they will enchant many. With their witchcraft and enchantments, they will seduce the world to accept their poison, and they will permanently poison those who love the world with their sorceries, for the mark of the beast will be disguised as medicine. Even the serpents bite of which their system has already been rolled out and tested, and the masses have already been conditioned to accept their mark and their operation war seed was a success.</p>
<p>And so their system is ready for prime time, and they have prepared their social scores and all will be controlled who live in their cities and their society. For they will have to take the mark of the beast to participate in their satanic society, even the kingdom of the Dragon. Those who take the mark will be forever altered. Their very genetics will be altered, for they will mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay. Their beastly mark, even the serpents bite, will utterly decimate all who take their poison and there is no escape.</p>
<p>Even all of those who take the mark will be forever altered, and they will find themselves part of their system, and they will be intertwined by technologies and their minds will no longer be their own. They will be controlled and will be as the walking dead, they will be forever slaves to the hive mind of their system, even of their technologies for they will be meshed together with the internet of things to be. They will lose their own will, and they will have no feeling and anything of God will forever be erased from them because they will alter themselves into an unredeemable state, and they will fully and forever join themselves to the fallen ones and forever will belong to the dragon and to the great lake of fire will they go forevermore. And so will be the fate of their own choosing.</p>
<p>For the finality of their choice is irrevocable. And their plagues and sores and sicknesses will be many, and even though they will be promised health and peace, health and peace they will never have. Because Satan endeavors to use his sorceries to fight against the wrath and judgments of God and to poison and kill the masses, but no relief will they have and those who partake of his sorceries will never escape. Those who take the mark will glow under their dark lights, and their lights will line the streets of their cities they have prepared for their slaves. Understand that these will be the walking damned who have no forgiveness and who can never recover, for these are those whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the Lamb, slain from the foundation of the world. And no salvation will ever be had amongst them nor in their society, for to walk among them and join their society will absolutely require the mark of the beast.</p>
<p>My two witnesses will testify until the times of their testimony are completed for 42 months is given. And so it will be given to the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit to make war against them, and he shall overcome them, and kill them, even my two olive trees, and two candlesticks when they have finished their testimony. And their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also your Lord was crucified. And the wicked will make great celebration and give gifts to one another on account of their deaths. And after three and a half days the Spirit of life from God will enter into them: and they will stand upon their feet, and great fear will fall upon all which saw them. And they heard a great voice from heaven, saying to them, come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies will behold them ascend into the heavens into everlasting life and forever will they be changed. And the seventh Angel will sound, and there will be great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever and ever.</p>
<p>(Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth, yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors, and their works do follow them.)</p>
<p>And so the greatest tribulation ever will begin, even though tribulation is constant during Daniel's seventieth week. And their temple will be finished and the abomination of desolation will be accomplished by their false Moshiach. And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the middle of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of the abominations, he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation determined shall be poured upon the desolate.</p>
<p>These will be the darkest times my children, for I Yeshua HaMashiach do tell you these things before they happen, and they are written as a warning to all. And so will my 144,000 come to the aid of those who would otherwise perish and who call on my name. I will lead them step by step, and they will do many mighty works for me. For these are those who are taken in the gathering of the saints to me, Christ Jesus, in the air at the sound of the last trumpet and the trumpet is about to sound.</p>
<p>These are my faithful, even those in whom was found no guile, for they have purified themselves as a chaste virgin in the blood of the Lamb which I offered forevermore as their high priest, for I am forevermore the high priest after the order of Melchizedek. These are my bride, and they will follow me wherever I go. Behold! I will make them powerful, and nothing has ever been seen on earth that can compare to the abilities with which I will clothe them. They will be clothed in fine, white, spotless linen and their abilities will embody their accomplishments and great abilities will they possess for they are faithful called and chosen even from before the foundations of the world by Yahweh for these purposes.</p>
<p>My 144,000 will descend on Mount Sion and I will lead them. They will take those I lead them to into the wilderness to be hidden away from the utter darkness and persecution of the enemies' kingdom. They will be led to safety from the seven plagues for in these judgments is the severity of the wrath of God to be poured out on the seat of the beast and to torment the kingdom of the dragon for great is their punishment. And the 144,000 will lead them to safety, they will heal them from their wounds, they will succor them and give them great hope to call on the name of the Lord even to the end if need be. For had I not shortened the days, no flesh would be left alive. And so they will complete that in which I will lead them.</p>
<p>And when the times are accomplished so it will be, even as it is written and as it is written so let it be done: And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse, and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true, and in righteousness he does judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns, and he had a name written, that no man knew but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood, and his name is called, The word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And he hath on his vesture, and on his thigh a name written, King Of Kings, And Lord Of Lords.</p>
<p>And so I, even Jesus the Nazarene, even the Lamb of God, even Christ Jesus who is also the Lion of the Tribe of Judah will come to judge and make war on the Dragon and all his kingdom will be utterly smashed never to rise again. And the beast and the false prophet will be cast alive into the lake of fire and Satan will be chained with a great chain in the bottomless pit for a thousand years and so my millennial reign will begin and in righteousness will my rule be. Behold! I bring my bride and a host of kings and priests with whom I will rule the earth in righteousness and I will rule the nations with a rod of iron. So have great hope my children for the consummation of all things is at hand and this seven year period of great trouble, even Jacob's trouble will be followed by my righteous rule and Yahweh will be all in all.</p>
<p>And I saw a new heaven, and a new earth: for the first heaven, and the first earth were passed away, and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy City, new Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold, the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.</p>
<p>I Yeshua HaMashiach have sent these Words by my servant, and by my servant have these Words been sent!</p>
<div class="indent">
<p>I am the Lion of the Tribe of Judah.</p>
<p>I am King of Kings and Lord of Lords!</p>
<p>I am he who speaks of things to come as if they have already occurred.</p>
<p>I am the Word made flesh who dwells among you by my holy spirit that is born within you forevermore.</p>
<p>I am forevermore the high priest after the order of Melchizedek.</p>
<p>I am he who is a light to the Gentiles and is the savior of the nations for all who have made me Lord.</p>
<p>I am he whom the Great I AM has sent for the salvation of Israel, for a remnant of Jacob will yet be saved.</p>
